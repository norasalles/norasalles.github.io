        <p><span class="span_2">This chapter provides a detailed overview of using the Live Connect feature in </span><span class="span_2">ClientBase. </span>
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>One of the most innovative features in <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> is Live Connect which is found in the Res Card. Save time and improve efficiency by transmitting selected client information to a booking engine on-line. Then electronically transmit back reservation details and automatically complete the reservation form with what’s been booked to generate invoices. </p>
        <p><span>Note to ALL </span><span class="span_3">ClientBase</span><span> Users: </span>New Live Connects Providers are added between <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> releases all the time. View the newest list on the Trams website here:</p>
        <p><a href="http://static.trams.com/tramslibrary/liveconnect/index.html">http://static.trams.com/tramslibrary/liveconnect/index.html</a>
        </p>
        <p><span>Note to </span><span class="span_3">Trams Back Office</span><span> and </span><span class="span_3">ClientBase</span><span> Windows Users: </span>(As <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> shares a database with <span class="span_3">Trams Back Office</span>, the invoices generated from the Res Card automatically become part of the invoices shared with <span class="span_3">Trams Back Office</span>.) <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> continues to add more on-line booking engines to connect to via Live Connect. All Live Connect Provider settings, including login information and vendor profile setup can be done in <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> Windows, or if a user has been granted administrative permission can be done in <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> under <span>Tools|Settings </span>(only in a <span>Primary-Sync database (</span><span class="span_3">ClientBase</span><span> Windows) or a Non-Sync activated database in </span><span class="span_3">ClientBase</span><span>). </span></p>
