            <MadCap:keyword term="Other Profiles, Overview">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles</h1>
        <p class="p_1">This section familiarizes you with how to setup, maintain and use Other Profiles.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Other profiles are used for gathering information and maintaining history on individuals and companies that do not fit into one of the other profile categories. They are not leisure or corporate customers, vendors/service providers, or agents, but are individuals or companies with whom you do business that are usually not travel-related. The landlord, bank, utility companies, insurance provider and the post office are all examples of <span class="span_2">Other</span> profiles. </p>
        <p>Why would you want to collect information on other profiles? When these profiles are carefully maintained, you always have current information for billing purposes and running labels. When you need help or a special favor from one of these entities, it is always helpful to have the name, phone number or email of your contact person handy.</p>
        <p><span>Note: </span>Most agents are probably not granted access to <span class="span_2">Other</span> profiles, since there would be no need for them to access this information. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Create a New Other Profile</h2>
        <p>New Other profiles can be created by clicking on the profile icon on the tool bar and selecting <span class="span_2">Other. </span></p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other.png" style="height: 164px;width: 624px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Want a quick way to create a profile? Use the following <span class="span_2">hot key:</span></p>
        <p class="p_2">Alt shift O = New Other.</p>
        <p>After clicking <span class="span_2">Create Profile</span>, you can enter information on a new Other profile on the <span class="span_2">Quick Entry</span> form. The Quick Entry form consists of two screens, one for the Profile and one for the <span class="span_2">Primary Contact</span>. All Required and Optional fields are displayed, along with the basics: <span class="span_2">Profile Type, Profile Name, Last Name/First Name/Middle Name/Courtesy Title, Address, Primary Phone, Interface ID, and Branch</span>. Required and optional fields are indicated with peach and green shading, respectively.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When you click on <span class="span_2">Next, </span>you land on the Primary Contact screen, and after a user fills in the fields and clicks <span class="span_2">Save</span>, a search is performed behind the scenes based on the name fields and the phone and email fields. If a match is found, the user is prompted with a list of the matching Traveler/Contacts and is given the opportunity to either link the existing Traveler/Contact to the new Profile, or to cancel out and create a new Contact. <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_1.jpg" style="height: 317px;width: 614px;" class="img_1" /></p>
        <p>If a user does not have permission to access a certain profile type, they will be unable to create profiles of that type. If a user has no permission to view a profile tab which has required fields for a certain profile type, the user will not be able to create a profile of that type. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Anatomy of an Other Profile</h2>
        <p>Other profiles in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> store an unlimited amount of information about your Other entities. To organize all this information and make it easily accessible to all agents, each profile is made up of key areas (<span class="span_2">Menu Bar, Header Info, Indicator Icon, </span>and <span class="span_2">Information links</span>.)</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_2.jpg" style="width: 588px;height: 310px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Let’s explore each of these key areas:</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Header Information</h3>
        <p>The Header conveniently displays pertinent information including the current mailing address, communication entries captured for this profile, Email and Website addresses, and the date the profile was created. Frequently confirm the accuracy of this information to ensure data is always up-to-date.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Menu Bar</h3>
        <p>The menu bar contains links to features - <span class="span_2">Merge Options, Note, Mailer and Reminder.</span> </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_3.jpg" style="height: 53px;width: 581px;" class="img_1" />

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Merge To Document </span>enables you to launch a Document Template from the results of a query into Wordpad, MS Word, Open Office, etc. to view, edit and print the document with all fields merged. <span class="span_2">Merge To Email </span>launches an email message for the profile you are in. <span class="span_2">Merge To Label</span> enables you to create a label for this profile. </p>
        <p>You can also create a <span class="span_2">Note, Mailer, or Reminder </span>from the menu bar for the profile you are in, or link to another profile by using the three dots next to <span class="span_2">Profile</span> field<span class="span_2">. </span></p>
        <p>For complete instructions on <span class="span_2">Merge To Document, Merge to Email, </span>or <span class="span_2">Merge to Label, </span>see chapter, <span class="span_2">Putting Profiles to Work for You.</span> </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Header Information</h3>
        <p>The Header conveniently displays pertinent information including the current mailing address, communication entries, Email and Website addresses, groups, and the date it was created. Frequently confirm the accuracy of this information to ensure data is always up-to-date.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Profile Indicator</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>An icon (a calendar) alerts you if there are any open reminders for this profile. This does not appear in the profile if there is no open reminder. Click the icon to immediately move into that Activities Link.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Other Profile Links">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Detailed Review of Links</h2>

        <p><span class="span_3">Create User/Create Date</span><span>:</span> These fields default to the system date and the user logged in at the time the profile is created. Both of these fields can be modified. </p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Profile Status:</span> Indicate whether a vendor profile is <span class="span_2">Inactive</span> from the drop-down menu. By default all profiles start with an <span class="span_2">Active</span> status. An <span class="span_2">Inactive </span>status is included so that you can flag a vendor as inactive without having to delete the profile. When searching in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database, only profiles marked as <span class="span_2">Active</span> will be included in the search. Search for <span class="span_2">Inactive Profiles</span> by using the <span class="span_2">Advanced Search</span> option.</p>

        <h3 class="Heading3">Communication Link</h3>
        <p>If no name is displayed, it is a profile-level communication entry. Notice the Marketing Permission, Invalid, and Primary indicators. Communications are sorted thus - Profile communications are listed first, then the Primary Contacts's communications, then the remaining Contact communications, in the order that the contacts are listed in the Contacts section. Within each of those divisions, Primary Communication entries are listed first, then non-primary entries. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_7.jpg" style="width: 622px;height: 130px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The standardized format for unlimited communication entries in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides a platform upon which this information can be easily accessed<span class="span_2">. </span>When creating a communication, click on <span class="span_2">Add Communication</span>, fill in correct communication details, and click <span class="span_2">Save</span>. </p>

        <p>This area contains the following fields:</p>
        <p><span class="span_4">Contact:</span> From the drop-down menu choose what contact this communication entry is connected with (if applicable). </p>
        <p><span class="span_4">Type:</span> Options include <span class="span_2">Email, Fax, Phone, Web, Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, Google Plus</span>. Communication Type options include Social Media. This begins the first phase of social media integration. Fields are now available to begin capturing social media information in order to connect to social media profiles/page(s) in a future release.)</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_9.jpg" style="height: 149px;width: 123px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Begin capturing information by clicking Additional Communications and click Add. Select a contact and click the drop down to choose a Type from the list. The new types for social media use are:</p>
        <p class="p_6">Facebook</p>
        <p class="p_6">Twitter</p>
        <p class="p_6">Linked In</p>
        <p class="p_6">Google Plus</p>
        <p>After choosing the Type, enter the User ID (example: facebook.com/JohnSmith). User ID format will vary depending upon the social media type. Next, select a Description. User defined descriptions can be created for specific use with social media. For example, John Smith may have a personal profile in Facebook, along with a business page for his company. A description of "Profile" and another of "Page" could be added to differentiate between whether the User ID entered is for the customer's profile or his business page. </p>
        <p>Example Formats for capturing user's social media information:</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Facebook: </span>For a profile - facebook.com/username (facebook.com/JohnSmith); For a page - facebook.com/page name (facebook.com/SabreTravel)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Twitter:</span> Twitter.com/username (Twitter.com/JohnSmith)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Linked In:</span> linkedin.com/pub/8/b8a/205</p>
        <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Linked In ID)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Google Plus:</span> plus.google.com/117474227900375467167</p>
        <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Google+ ID)</p>
        <p>Just like all other communication types, social media communication types have a Marketing Permission checkbox. Marketing Permission is unchecked by default.</p>
        <p><span>Note: </span>For emails, a green check appears if the entry has been granted marketing permission.</p>
        <p><span class="span_4">Profile’s Primary</span><span class="span_2">:</span> Indicate if this is the primary phone number, fax, Email, or Web address, since only one entry per communication type may be designated as Primary. </p>
        <p><span class="span_4">Entry</span><span class="span_2">:</span> You need only type the 7 digits of the Fax number or Phone number if in your area code, as <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> version adds a default country code and area code to the number when saved. For numbers outside your area code, type in the 10 digit area code and number (no other typing is necessary). For Email and Web entries, type these exactly as you want it to appear.</p>
        <p><span class="span_4">Description</span><span class="span_2">: </span>Choose a description if desired from drop-down menu. These options were setup by the database administrator in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="span_4">Save/Cancel</span><span class="span_2">:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Save</span> to accept new information or <span class="span_2">Cancel</span>. </p>
        <p>As alternative methods of communicating with customers continue to expand (e.g. cell phones, beepers, additional Emails, etc.), you may find your phone tables growing increasingly lengthy for profiles. You have the ability to maintain an unlimited number of communication entries.</p>
        <p>To modify an entry, click <span class="span_2">Edit</span> next to the communication you wish to alter, make changes, and click <span class="span_2">Save. </span>To remove an entry, click <span class="span_2">Edit </span>next to the communication you wish to remove, and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Remarks Link</h3>
        <p>The Remarks link provides a full-page view of the unlimited remarks and provides tremendous flexibility for entering comments in each vendor/service provider profile. To add or edit a remark, click <span class="span_2">Edit Text</span>, and click <span class="span_2">Save</span> or <span class="span_2">Cancel. </span>The great thing about remarks is that the first few lines can be viewed from anywhere in the profile. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Contacts Link</h3>
        <p class="p_5">

        </p>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Contact </span>link is designed for detailed information on specific individuals who are key contacts for this entity.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_11.jpg" style="width: 602px;height: 449px;" />

        </p>
        <p>A birthday present icon appears during the contact's birthday month and disappears once the birthday month has passed. A red exclamation point icon appears if the contact has an expired passport or credit card. Clicking on the exclamation point icon takes the user to Card record if it's an expired credit card, or to the Advanced Contact Info tab if it's an expired passport. The icon disappears when the expiration date is updated.The Contacts’ link is designed for entering detailed information on specific individuals who are part of a particular profile. The link is called Traveler when working with an <span class="span_2">Leisure </span>profile, and Contacts when working within any other profile<span class="span_2">.</span></p>
        <p>Add a new contact by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>.

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Search</span> button in the Contacts screen replaces the old Copy and Paste functions in previous versions. If a user knows that the contact they want already exists in another profile in the database, they can click <span class="span_2">Search</span> and bring up a Contact Search screen with the following fields available: <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_14.jpg" style="height: 191px;width: 446px;" class="img_1" /></p>

        <p>- Last Name</p>
        <p>- E-mail Address</p>
        <p>- Phone</p>
        <p>Users can search by phone or e-mail address alone, or in combination with any of the name fields. If searching by name only, users must enter something in at least two of the three name fields.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Valid Examples:</span> </p>
        <p>**User enters First Name of Ken and an e-mail address of ken@example.com. Ken Able, who has that address, is returned; Ken Jones, who does not have that e-mail address, is not.</p>
        <p>**User knows the last name, but isn't sure exactly how the first name is spelled. He enters First Name A and last name Smith. All contacts whose first name starts with A (Alice, Anne, Alex) and last name starts with Smith (Smith, Smithers, Smith-Jones) are returned.</p>
        <p>**User knows that Mary Anne Jones has married, but doesn't remember the contact's new last name. She enters First Name Mary and Middle Name Anne. All contacts with that first and middle name are returned.</p>
        <p>**User knows the contact's phone number and enters (650) 555-1212. All contacts with that phone number are returned. </p>

In the past when a travel preference was created for a contact it applied to the travel category, not a vendor. For example, if a contact had an air preference of business class but liked first class for one of his/her preferred airlines, there wasn't a way to capture both. Now the business class air preference can be captured as the global preference for the travel category as well as capturing first class as the preference for the specific preferred vendor. Even though preferences are now captured at the vendor level, it is not mandatory to select preferred preferences for a vendor. It is also not mandatory to select preferred vendors for a contact. </p><p>To set up/modify preferences, on the Contact screen, select a contact and click Edit. Scroll down to the desired Travel Category. Each Travel Category shows a "Preferred" section that lists the vendors, with a "Preference" section underneath it. When a vendor is highlighted, the Preference section will change accordingly, displaying the preferences for that vendor.</p><p>A <span class="span_2">General Preference</span> is available to each Travel Category under Preferred. Highlight the General Preference and enter the global preferences for the category in the Preference section below it. When a preferred vendor is later added to a Travel Category, the preference settings from General Preference are defaulted as the preferences for the new vendor. Next, make adjustments to the new vendor's preferences as needed. A field, <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> can be used as a rating for a vendor. For example, United Airlines may be a preferred airline for a corporate account but the contact traveling for the company may <span class="span_2">Dislike</span> that airline. By entering the <span class="span_2">Desirability</span>, if you see that the contact dislikes United, he/she could be booked on another preferred airline the corporate account uses. The <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> field is displayed when adding or viewing a preferred vendor. Desirability options appear as a drop down to select from. Selections are: <span class="span_2">Do Not Use; Dislikes; No Preference; Favorable; or Very Favorable.</span></p><p>All Travel Categories use the user-defined field <span class="span_2">Special Options</span>. Under Air Preferences, Meal Preferences was renamed to Meal Type which links to a Meal Code field that was also added. Air Craft Type was also added as a preference. For Cruise Preferences, Ship Name and Departure Port were added as user defined fields and are displayed as preference options. When using contact columns for preferences in queries, the default global preferences are displayed in the query.</p><p><span class="span_3">Save/Cancel</span><span>:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Save</span> to accept new information, or <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> to leave area without saving changes. </p><h3 class="Heading3">Activities Link</h3><p>Anyone can see the history of contacts made with this particular entity as long as they have been granted permission.

These files are referred to as <span class="span_2">Attachments</span>.</p><p>To access an attachment, click the <span class="span_2">Attachment </span>link. To add a new Attachment click <span class="span_2">Add Attachment</span>, and <span class="span_2">Browse for Attachment </span>to identity the File Path of the file. The File Path includes the drive where the file is located, any directories or sub-directories, and the name of the file. Choose to compress the file by clicking in the Compression box. Enter a brief description of the attachment, if desired. Click <span class="span_2">Save</span>.</p><p><img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An in-depth look at other profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_18.jpg" style="width: 633px;height: 164px;" /></p><p>To view a saved attachment, highlight the attachment, and click <span class="span_2">Open </span>next to the attachment. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses Windows associations to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp, .html, etc.) that must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the attachment created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p><p>Since a copy of the file has been stored within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database when it is opened at a workstation, it is loaded temporarily into a temp directory. If any changes are made to the original file or the temporary file, the attachment in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> must be re-directed to the new file, or the old file will still be displayed. This is done by using <span class="span_2">Edit</span> and browsing for the updated file. Once this is done, the copy of the file saved in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database is updated.</p><p>Click <span class="span_2">Edit, </span>then <span class="span_2">Delete</span>, next to the attachment to remove it. </p><p>&#160;</p></body>
