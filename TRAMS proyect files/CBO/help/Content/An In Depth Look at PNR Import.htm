        <p class="p_1">This chapter provides a detailed overview of using the PNR Import feature in ClientBase. PNR Import is currently available for Amadeus, Apollo/Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan.</p>
        <p>Reservations stored within an Amadeus, Apollo/Galileo, Sabre, or Worldspan PNR can be imported into <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>, and new reservation records can be created within the reservation tab of the Res Card. Once the new reservations reside in the Res Card, print out trip proposals, itineraries, or add additional reservations using Live Connect and generate invoices.</p>
        <p><span>Note for every GDS:</span> For troubleshooting purposes, PNR Import for each GDS can create a copy of the file being imported and saved locally for review. To automatically create a PNR Import log file, create the following directory on your workstation: My Documents\Trams\<span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>. Each time PNR Import is performed the ImportLog.txt file will be overwritten with the current PNR.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">
            <MadCap:keyword term="PNR Import Amadeus">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>PNR Import for Amadeus</h2>
        <p>The PNR Import for Amadeus takes air, car, hotel and rail segments included in an Amadeus PNR and imports them into <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> Res Card reservation records. (For tour and cruise reservations, use Live Connect instead of the PNR Import.)</p>
        <p>Amadeus uses the Amadeus Selling Platform (see the section about the traditional command pages in Amadeus) as you’ll need that to work with merge/import. If you are on terminal services and CB is not then use the clipboard. </p>
        <p class="p_2">Setup Instructions</p>
        <p>1) For all users, download the following cbbcomps.exe:</p>
        <p><a href="http://static.trams.com/tramslibrary/releaseandupdatefiles/updates/utilities/CBBComps.EXE">http://static.trams.com/tramslibrary/releaseandupdatefiles/updates/utilities/CBBComps.EXE</a>
        </p>
        <p>2) Run on each workstation to install and register the necessary GDS files for this feature to work.</p>
        <p>3) Verify your APS or Vista +Script tool is activated.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Steps to Import a PNR from Amadeus</h3>
        <p>1) Be sure you are currently logged into both Amadeus and <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>.</p>
        <p>2) Create a new Res Card or open an existing Res Card within the appropriate client profile in <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>.</p>
        <p>3) Click on the PNR Import button on the main Res Card menu bar.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 An in-depth look and pnr import/An In Depth Look at PNR Import.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>4) Select Amadeus from the drop down list in the GDS field.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 An in-depth look and pnr import/An In Depth Look at PNR Import_1.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>5) Enter the desired Record Locator or leave the Record Locator field blank to import the current, active PNR.</p>
        <p>6) Click <span class="span_3">Next</span>. </p>
        <p>Multiple Reservations may be included in one PNR, therefore, multiple reservations may be imported as a result of the PNR import. All segments of an air itinerary will be imported into one reservation, but additional car and hotel reservations will be imported into separate reservation records.</p>
        <p>Each reservation imported into <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> must link to an existing Vendor profile within your <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> database. To locate the appropriate Vendor profile and automatically link to it, the system uses the Interface ID within the CRS and matches to an Interface ID within your Vendor profiles. </p>
        <p>- If it finds a Vendor profile with the same Interface ID, it imports the Reservation automatically. </p>
        <p>- If it does not find the Interface ID, then a prompt appears indicating the Interface ID it could not find. Use the <span class="span_3">Select Vendor</span> field to query your Vendor profiles and manually attach the reservation to the proper Vendor profile. If the Vendor is not in your database then use the <span class="span_3">Create Vendor</span> and add the Vendor profile accordingly. Avoid accidentally creating duplicate Vendor profiles by making sure Interface ID's are captured properly within the Vendor profiles you work with frequently.</p>
        <p>- If it finds multiple matches on vendor ID, use the <span class="span_3">Select Vendor </span>field to query.</p>
        <p><span>Special Note: </span>When a PNR is imported from a GDS, the <span class="span_3">Invoiced Outside</span> <span class="span_3">of CB</span> is checked by default and the reservation amount is not included in the un-invoiced balance. This keeps the reservation from being invoiced twice.</p>
        <p>The Amadeus PNR import updates existing reservations. If the same PNR is imported multiple times, the systems now looks at the rec locator, vendor and confirmation number, and if all match, then it updates the existing reservation rather than appending it as another new reservation. </p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="PNR Import Apollo/Galileo">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>PNR Import for Apollo/Galileo</h2>
        <p>This feature takes air, car, hotel, and rail segments included in an Apollo/Galileo PNR and imports them into <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> Res Card reservation records. (For tour and cruise reservations, use Live Connect instead of the PNR Import.) </p>
        <p>Although ViewPoint does not need to be used to create or retrieve the PNR, it needs to be running in the background, as it is a View Point tool that we are utilizing that turns the PNR segments into a file that <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> can then parse and import into reservation records. </p>
        <p class="p_2">Setup Instructions</p>
        <p>For all users, download the following cbbcomps.exe and register the necessary files, including the Connection ID, for this feature to work:</p>

Next you create an invoice with those items which automatically land in <span class="span_3">Trams Back Office</span> with a <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> generated invoice number. Now you need to drive the ticket and service fee in Sabre in order to generate the ticket and MCO for the service fee. When you interface to Trams, you now have 2 invoices in Trams with different invoice numbers (one generated by <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>, the other by Sabre). There is no option with Sabre to drive just a ticket without generating an invoice number and interface record. </p><p><span>Solutions:</span> </p><p><span class="span_3">Option 1</span> - Drive the invoice for air and services fees from Sabre. Drive any other bookings from <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>. </p><p><span class="span_4">Example Bookings - Air, Cruise or Tour, Service Fee</span> </p><p>1. Once the data has been imported to the Res Card, uncheck the box, <span class="span_3">Include Summary of All Reservations</span>, so that only the invoiced items show on the <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> invoice. If there is a cruise or tour on the Res Card in conjunction with air and service fee, just invoice the cruise or tour from the Res Card. </p><p>2. Drive the ticket and MCO for the service fee from Sabre. </p><p><span>Results:</span> You have 2 invoices for the customer and 2 invoices in TBO (one from <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> and one from Sabre). There is an un-invoiced amount on the Res Card for the air and service fee.</p><p><span class="span_3">Option 2</span> - Create a separate POS queue in Sabre. Sabre may charge the agency to set this up as it is considered an additional "device." </p><p>1. The agency imports the PNR to the Res Card.</p><p>2. The agency drives the invoice in Sabre (to generate the ticket and MCO) with the command to send this interface record to an alternate POS queue. </p><p>POS Queue #1 - This queue transmits interface records to <span class="span_3">Trams Back Office</span> that are NOT imported into the Res Card. </p><p>POS Queue #2 - This queue holds interface records that were imported into the Res Card - hence they will never DX transmit this queue. Sabre needs to clean the records out of this queue periodically. </p><p><span>Results:</span> The agency would have one invoice with all bookings in the Res Card on it to give to the customer and one invoice in <span class="span_3">Trams Back Office</span>. </p><h2 class="Heading2"><MadCap:keyword term="PNR Import Worldspan">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>PNR Import for Worldspan</h2><p>This feature takes air, car, hotel, cruise, tour and rail segments included in a Worldspan PNR and imports them into <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> Res Card reservation records. Contact your Worldspan Account Manager to enable a DIR Device, assign you a unique agent Pool Name, and provide you with a unique agency Connection ID. Worldspan has waived all fees associated with enabling these features for <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> customers.</p><h3 class="Heading3">Setup Instructions</h3><p>1) Contact your Worldspan Account Manager to enable a DIR Device, assign you a unique agency Pool Name, and Obtain a unique agency Connection ID. </p><p>2) Your unique agency Connection ID needs to be added to a registry setting at <span>each</span> workstation from which you plan to run <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>. To set this registry setting from each workstation, Go to <a href="http://www.trams.com/home/support/misc_downloads/"><span class="Hyperlink_1">http://www.trams.com/home/support/misc_downloads/</span></a> <span class="Hyperlink_2">and s</span>elect Workstation GDS API Files.&#160; Move down the page to Worldspan and click on the red letters (<span class="span_5">here</span>)<span class="span_5">.&#160; </span>A prompt may appear twice, select Run both times. Enter the connection ID when prompted.&#160; </p><p>3) <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> needs to pass an Agent Sine, and your Agency Pool Name to Worldspan when PNR Import is performed. To set this so it defaults automatically, you can enter each Agent Sine and Agency Pool Name into each User Login record. </p><p>To do this, have each User log into <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> and go to <span>Tools|My Login|PNR Import</span>. Click Add and set the CRS to Worldspan, entering agent's login Sine into Agent Sine, and Agency Pool Name into the field Pool Name. Each time this User performs a PNR Import the Agent Sine and Agency Pool Name default automatically. The SYSDBA can also enter this information into each User Login record by logging into <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> as the SYSDBA and going to <span>Tools|Settings|User Logins</span> and retrieving each Login record and updating accordingly.</p><p><span>Special Note: </span>Worldspan has changed the way agents log into Worldspan. Previously agents used the format BSI$1234RE/GS and ClientBase used this sine in setup under <span>Tools|MyLogin|PNR</span> <span>Import</span> as 1234RE/GS to work with the PNR Import feature. Worldspan now has agents changing the format of their login to 8-12 character with at least one character being numeric and they now have to add a slash and a password. This password changes every 90 days. Agents will need change their sine in ClientBase to the following format 1234RE/GS/Password, inserting their true password in that entry. Without changing this in ClientBase, PNR Import will not work. </p><p><span class="span_3">For agents who do not want to change the password every 90 days, they can complete Worldspan's Password Exemption Qualification Request Form and file for exemption.</span> </p><h3 class="Heading3">Steps to Import a Worldspan PNR</h3><p>To import a PNR from Worldspan take the following steps:</p><p>1) Create a new Res Card or open an existing Res Card within the appropriate client profile in <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>. </p><p>2) Click on the PNR Import button on the main Res Card menu bar.</p><p><img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 An in-depth look and pnr import/An In Depth Look at PNR Import.jpg" /></p><p>&#160;</p><p>3) Select Worldspan from the drop down list in the GDS field. </p><p><img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 An in-depth look and pnr import/An In Depth Look at PNR Import_5.jpg" /></p><p>4) Enter the desired Record Locator and be sure the Agent Sine default is complete or enter your agent sine/GS (i.e 9999DS/GS).</p><p>5) Click the Next button. </p><p>Each reservation imported into <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> must link to an existing Vendor profile within your <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> database.
