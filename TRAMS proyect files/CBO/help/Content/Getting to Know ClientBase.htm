            <MadCap:keyword term="ClientBase Overview">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Getting to Know ClientBase</h1>
        <p class="p_1">This section provides a general overview of ClientBase. The features of the program are broadly discussed in this chapter with an in-depth look at each of the features and its application within your agency in succeeding sections.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>At the heart of <span class="span_2">ClientBase </span>is the ability to locate, modify and use the information held within an agency’s database. Your database contains a wealth of knowledge on past and present customer and vendor relationships. Being able to easily access and use this valuable information to maintain existing relationships and build new ones may very well establish the future success of your agency. <span class="span_2">ClientBase </span>is the tool of choice to easily access, manage, update and use this valuable database information. We’ll show you how! </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">ClientBase Main Screen</h2>
        <p>The first screen to appear after logging on is the main screen. To become better acquainted with the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> features, it may be helpful to think of the screen as being divided into six sections:</p>
        <p class="p_2">1. Browser Items </p>
        <p>
            <span>2.</span> <span>File Managers, Tools, Help, Log off</span></p>
        <p>
            <span>3.</span> <span>Menu Items</span></p>

            <span>4.</span> <span>Search (Query) Filters</span></p>
        <p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Meet the File Managers, Tools, Help, Log Out</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The File Managers consists of <span class="span_2">Profiles,</span> <span class="span_2">Activities, </span>and<span class="span_2"> Res Cards</span>. <span class="span_2">Profiles</span> provide quick access to vital information about your clients (Leisure or Corporate), Service Provider, Vendor, Agent and Other profiles (non-travel related entities, such as the electric company or landlord). From this area <span class="span_2">locate, add, </span>or <span class="span_2">modify</span> profile records. </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_2">Activities </span>allow you to easily manage activity data (Notes, Reminders and Mailers) and provides query filters and results listed by Activity. <span class="span_2">Res Cards Manager</span> allow you to easily manage Res Card data, and provides query filters and results listed by Res Cards.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">

        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 2 Getting to Know ClientBase/Getting to Know ClientBase_2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>When clicking <span class="span_2">Profiles</span>, search (or query) filters appear or select a link which contains a stored set of query filters (<span class="span_2">Global </span>or<span class="span_2"> Personal Saved Searches</span>) from the drop-down menus. You can also use a simple or advanced search to enter a custom search. (To view all profiles, click <span class="span_2">Find.</span>)</p>
        <p>When querying a profile, enter the first few letters and the system automatically displays all names that are possible matches. For example, if you are searching for the client, Janet Sharp, type Sharp in the Profile Name/Company field and the system automatically displays any profile with the last name of Sharp. If you type Sharp/J, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> further filters the names showing only those with Sharp as the last name and the first names that start with a "J". This works for all Profile Types and all Profile name fields.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 2 Getting to Know ClientBase/Getting to Know ClientBase_3.png" style="width: 613px;height: 234px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Global Saved Searches </span>represent a set of search filters and column arrangements that have been saved and named. With a single click of the mouse from these drop-down menus, these links automatically complete search filters and display results after clicking <span class="span_2">Find</span>. The <span class="span_2">Personal Saved Searches</span> represent folders that have been saved by you and can only be seen and utilized on your own login.</p>
        <p>To retrieve a specific profile, click<span class="span_2"> View</span> next to the entry or the action menu icon (gear). </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>This icon is displayed to the right of <span class="span_2">View</span> and is listed for each record in the query. It has been designed to allow you to perform a variety of actions for that one record without having to open the record first - saving you a few extra clicks of the mouse. </p>

        </p>
        <p>When opening <span class="span_2">Activities</span>, search filters are entered by default or you may select a link which contains a stored set of search fields (<span class="span_2">Global </span>or<span class="span_2"> Personal Saved Searches</span>) from the drop-down menus<span class="span_2">. </span>You can also use the simple or advanced filters to enter a custom search. (Clicking <span class="span_2">Find</span> displays all activities.)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Global Saved Searches </span>represent a set of search filters and column arrangements that have been saved and named. With a single click of the mouse from these drop-down menus, these links automatically complete search filters and display results after clicking <span class="span_2">Find</span>. The <span class="span_2">Personal Saved Searches </span>represent folders that have been saved by you and can only be seen and utilized on your own login.</p>
        <p>To retrieve a specific activity, click<span class="span_2"> View</span> next to the entry or the action menu icon (gear). </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_2">Edit </span>takes you directly into the activity, or <span class="span_2">Go to Profile</span> takes you directly into the profile for which the activity was created. A new activity can be created at any time in <span class="span_2">Profiles, Activities, </span>or <span class="span_2">Res Cards </span>by clicking the <span class="span_2">Note, Mailer </span>or <span class="span_2">Reminder </span>menu item on the menu bar. </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_2">Res Cards </span>replace the paper index Res Card and file folders that have for years cluttered agencies. In the past, agents entered details of many leisure type reservations (client information, confirmation numbers, itineraries, vendor information, remarks, etc.) on cards or yellow paper pads. Agents kept these cards somewhere on their desk or somewhere in the file. That “somewhere” translated into precious time spent searching for Res Cards, especially when the booking agent was not available and another agent had to locate the card. </p>
        <p>With <span class="span_2">Res Cards</span>, you now have a tool to organize and maintain reservation information in a central database. If agents get in the habit when talking with clients or vendor/service providers of entering the details directly into the Res Card rather than jotting the notes on paper when a customer calls, any agent is able to answer questions or update information by accessing the customer’s Res Card. (This data provides valuable reports for management as well.)</p>
        <p>Clicking <span class="span_2">Res Cards</span> allows you to search and manage the database for Res Cards. </p>
        <p>Stored searches for the Res Card Manager are available for selection from the drop-down <span class="span_2">Global Saved Searches</span> and<span class="span_2"> Personal Saved Searches </span>as well as the simple and advanced search areas to enter a custom search. From this area, <span class="span_2">locate, add, modify </span>or <span class="span_2">delete</span> Res Cards. Upon entering <span class="span_2">Res Cards</span> and clicking <span class="span_2">Find</span>, by default the system displays active Res Cards. </p>
        <p>To retrieve a specific Res Card, click<span class="span_2"> View</span> next to the entry or the action menu icon (gear). </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_2">Edit </span>takes you directly into the Res Card, <span class="span_2">Invoice</span> takes you directly into the generate invoice area of the Res Card, and <span class="span_2">Go to Profile</span> takes you directly into the profile for which the Res Card was created. Res Cards automate your manual reservation data and provide the means to generate itineraries and invoices for customers and track client balances. </p>

            <span>Page History:</span> The page history area "remembers" the last places you have navigated to in the program. To quickly hop back into a recently visited area, simple click on that link.</p>
        <p>
            <span>Settings:</span> Access the ability to customize <span class="span_2">Settings, Branch Settings, </span>and<span class="span_2"> User Logins</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <span>Mask Credit Card Number: </span>Remove (purge) credit card information for Payments, Booking CommTrack CC Numbers and Reservation Deposit CC Numbers no longer of use. Masking a credit card number removes the full encrypted credit card number and replaces it with a masked version of the number. To use this feature the database must be credit card encrypted. The feature can be disabled for any user by selecting the user login settings under <span>Advanced|Other Restrictions</span> and checking the box <span class="span_2">Disable Ability to Mask Credit Card Number</span>. Select <span>Tools|Mask Credit Card Number</span>. In the Records to Mask field, choose the type of record to remove from the drop down. Options for removal are:</p>
        <p>*Payments (EFT, CC, CC Merchant)</p>
        <p>*Booking CommTrack CC Numbers</p>
        <p>*Reservation Deposit CC Numbers</p>
        <p>In the <span class="span_2">Purge As Of</span> field, enter the Purge Date. For example, if you want to remove records prior to 01/01/2011, the Purge Date is 12/31/2010. Records are removed by date as follows:</p>
        <p>*Payments (by Payment Date)</p>
        <p>*Booking CommTrack CC Numbers (by Depart Date)</p>
        <p>*Reservation Deposit CC Numbers (by Deposit Due Date) </p>
        <p>After entering the purge date click the <span class="span_2">Mask Credit Card Number</span> button. A message appears indicating what type of records will be masked and as of what date. Click <span class="span_2">Yes</span> to continue or <span class="span_2">No</span> to return to the selection criteria.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>
            <span> Users</span>: If your database is also used with <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>, do not purge using the options of Payments or Booking CommTrack CC Numbers, as these affect accounting data and therefore removal must occur in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>. If either option is chosen, upon clicking the mask button to precede you will receive the warning, "Permanent masking of payment entries will affect accounting history and should be managed in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>." Please note that if you continue, you risk ruining your accounting data.</p>
        <p>
            <span>Sync Users:</span> The feature can only be used from the Primary database.</p>
        <p>
            <span>Import Profile:</span> Import data into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> in the form of an ASCII (.txt) file. Directions are in section entitled, <span class="span_2">Set Up to Use ClientBase.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span>Case Converter: </span>ClientBase has the ability to convert cases of some of the fields in the program. For complete directions on this feature, go to section, <span class="span_2">Using the Profile Manager to Manager Your Profiles.</span></p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_3">User Settings:</span> Only the User Name, Title, Email and Password can be changed from this area. </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_3">Saved Search Defaults:</span> Each file manager (Profile, Activity, and Res Card) comes with a default set of folders, which represent a stored set of search filters. In addition to the default folders, your agency and agents can create their own custom folders. This area of the user login allows you to identify which folder should be opened by default (within each manager) when first signing into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Choose from the drop-down menu the types of transactions you want to see when first entering <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> with this login. </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_3">Profile Defaults:</span> Each profile type is made up of several links information. Under Profile Defaults, select which link fist appears when viewing each type of profile. For example, you may to see marketing information first thing, every time they retrieve a leisure client profile. If so, click the down arrow next to Leisure and select Marketing. You can select any link for any profile type.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_3">Communication Defaults:</span> The agency is no longer confined to its four walls. With so many outside agents and employees working from distant locations, customers come with many different area codes and even from different countries. Agent users have the opportunity to save default phone information as part of their log in. <span>Note: </span>If this screen is left blank, then information that is listed under Settings (Global Defaults) is used. </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_3">Live Connect:</span> This set-up setting area is for agencies who want to use Live Connect in the Res Card. Set up for Live Connect agent logins can be done in two ways - globally (if all agents share the same user name, password or account number), or individually. When Live Connect is launched, the system first looks to see if there is login information at the User Login level, and if not, then looks for the login information at the Settings (Global Defaults) level. </p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_3">Live Connect Provider:</span> Select from the drop-down list.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_2">User Name, Password and Account Number:</span> Enter the necessary fields based upon the login information provided to you by the Live Connect provider.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="span_2">Setting up Individual Login Information:</span> To set up Live Connect for <span>each</span> user login, click on the Live Connect tab in the User Setting. Click <span class="span_2">Add </span>to add a Live Connect Provider User. </p>
        <p>(For a complete overview of use Live Connect, please refer to the chapter <span class="span_2">An In-Depth Look at Live Connect</span>.)</p>

        <p>Currently only the Client Survey and the Profile Statistics Reports are available for use in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, but check back soon for additional reports. </p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">CLIENT SURVEY</h4>
        <p>The Client Survey report shows contact and marketing information an agency currently has on record for a client in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. The survey is given to clients to verify and/or update their information. The survey can be printed or e-mailed right from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Users may define what marketing tables and codes are included on the client survey printout. </p>
        <p>Set up the client survey defaults in under <span>Tools|Settings|Client Survey Report Settings</span>. Check the box next to any of the marketing tables that you want to include in Client Survey. There is also an option of Print only codes selected for profile, which when selected, does not print all marketing codes available, but just the codes that have already been checked off. These defaults can be overwritten each time a client survey is printed.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">STATISTICS REPORTS</h4>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Search Filters, Query">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Meet the Search Filters</h2>
        <p>Your database holds a wealth of information on your customers - marketing activities, communication and address information, traveler/contact preferences, and more. This information is of little value unless you can quickly and easily access the data you need. The search (query) feature provides filters to quickly sift through your data to match your required search criteria. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 2 Getting to Know ClientBase/Getting to Know ClientBase_6.jpg" style="height: 133px;width: 497px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>You have the ability to do simple or complex searches based on the selected search filters in the Profile, Activity or Res Card Managers. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Simple Search">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Simple Search</h3>
        <p>Quickly locate a profile or a group of profiles by completing one or two search filters in the simple search area.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 2 Getting to Know ClientBase/Getting to Know ClientBase_7.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>The drop-down field to the left identifies what you want to search by, and the blank field to the right provides an area to type in search data. If you choose to use both fields, then the criteria is strung together with an "and", not an "or", and only those profiles that meet both query fields are displayed as a match. </p>
        <p>When querying a profile, enter the first few letters and the system automatically displays all names that are possible matches. For example, if you are searching for the client, Jane Smith, type Smith in the Last Name field and the system automatically displays any profile with the last name of Smith. If you type Smith/J, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> further filters the names showing only those with Smith as the last name and the first names that start with a "J". This works for all Profile Types and all Profile name fields.</p>
        <p>All leisure clients with the last name starting with "smith" appear in the results area. Select the client name you want and click <span class="span_2">Find.</span></p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Advanced Search">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Advanced Search</h3>
        <p>Advanced Search provides additional filters that allow you to more narrowly define what you are looking for.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 2 Getting to Know ClientBase/Getting to Know ClientBase_8.jpg" style="width: 668px;height: 457px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Search filters are selected by clicking <span class="span_2">Go to Advanced Search</span>, then <span class="span_2">Enter Data to Search by, </span>and completing as many of the search fields as desired in the <span class="span_2">General Info, Marketing, Activities, Traveler, Res Cards </span>or <span class="span_2">More Field</span> links. Each field selected is strung together with an “and” that more narrowly defines the search. For example, you have just received a hot cruise special to Europe and want to get a number of all past and potential cruise clients interested in Europe and living in the 90045 zip code to see if you should do a mailing. Select <span class="span_2">Leisure</span> under <span class="span_2">Profile Type; </span>“90045” in the <span class="span_2">Zip Code </span>field; <span class="span_2">“</span>Europe” and "Cruise" under <span class="span_2">Marketing </span>categories and click <span class="span_2">OK. </span>You have selected the filters to search your database for all leisure clients who expressed an interest in cruising and want to go to Europe and live in the 90045 zip code area. When you click <span class="span_2">OK, </span>all clients in the database meeting the search criteria are displayed on the results screen.</p>
