        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Step Two:</span> Select CCRA from the vendor drop-down. Verify the default Login information and select <span class="span_2">Create New Reservation</span>.</p>
        <p>A window appears with your default login information. The Connect To should read CCRA Travel Hotel Booking Portal. If it does not, click the drop down arrow and select it from the list. Any of the login information defaulting in this window can be changed if desired. Use the <span class="span_2">Create New Reservations</span> button to book a new reservation.</p>
        <p>

Prior to connecting you to the CCRATravel Hotel Booking Portal site, a client selection screen appears, allowing you to select the desired client data you would like to automatically pass to CCRATravel Hotel Booking Portal.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span>Step Four:</span> Although still in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, you are now on-line at the CCRA booking site. </p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/CCRATravel Hotel Booking Portal1/CCRATravel Hotel Booking Portal.png" style="height: 275px;width: 502px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Finish confirming your Reservation and upon receiving a confirmation number click <span class="span_2">Import Reservation</span> to bring the reservation details into your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database for managing further. </p>
        <p>
            <span>Note: </span>If you want to use separate Hotel Vendors, the system will have you search for the hotel profile you have booked. If you do not find it in your system after you have queried, you must create a hotel profile and click the Live Connect button in the Vendor Profile before you save it to link CCRATravel Hotel Booking Portal to it by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. If you used the CCRATravel Hotel Booking Portal Profile at the reservation level to launch Live Connect, the hotel booking will come into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> with the hotel name in the Service Provider area of the reservation.</p>
        <p>This reservation information is now available for you to invoice, to create Reminders to track the administrative tasks involved in managing the trip and to report on for future marketing purposes.</p>

        <p>To cancel an existing reservation using Live Connect, follow these steps:</p>
