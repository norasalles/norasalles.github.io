        <p class="p_1">This section demonstrates how to use the powerful ClientBase features, Merge to Document, Merge to Email, Merge to File, Merge to Print, Merge to Label, and Merge to PNR.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Your agency has built a valuable database by consistently collecting and recording client data. Now it is time to put that data to work for you. Save valuable time by merging client profile data into PNR’s, document templates, labels, and files. Print out the results of queries for telemarketing or reference. By using the stored data in the profiles instead of manually typing client information each time, you not only cut work time, but also reduce the chances of typing errors. </p>
        <p>Also learn how to use the Case Converter feature to clean up names and addresses that may be in different cases. Need to globally change many profiles at one time? Learn how to use Global Modify.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Merge to Document</h2>
        <p>Sending personalized letters frequently helps build stronger relationships with clients. That's one of the things that <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> does best. A library of documents customized by the database administrator makes it easy to print personalized letters for your customers from Wordpad, Microsoft Word, Open Office, etc. The speed and ease of this feature gives agents reason to be more pro-active in their communication with customers, thus building customer loyalty. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Using to Merge Document</h3>
        <p>The first step in using the <span class="span_2">Merge to Doc </span>feature is to use the Profile Manager to find the profile(s) to merge with the document. When merging information into a document template, you have several choices. Merge the information to a document from the search results screen by:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Selecting the desired profile and clicking the action gear in the Profile Manager, and <span class="span_2">Merge to Document.</span></li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol start="2" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">From within a client profile, clicking the <span class="span_2">Merge Options|Merge To Document </span>drop-down on the menu bar. </li>

        </p>
        <p>3) Searching for a <span>group </span>of profiles in the Profile Manager and clicking the <span class="span_2">Merge Options|Merge To Document</span> on menu bar.</p>
        <p>When you click <span class="span_2">Merge To Document </span>or the action menu icon (gear in profile entry in Profile Results Screen) and <span class="span_2">Merge to Document</span>, a merge to document dialog box appears.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Browse for different document templates set up by the database administrator by using the drop-down menu. After selecting the document template, click <span class="span_2">Create Word Document. </span>Based on the selected template, a letter or a set of letters is merged with information from each client's profile into the Microsoft Word, Wordpad, Open Office, etc. application while you are still in the browser. View the document with all fields merged. From here the document can be edited, if desired, and printed. </p>
        <p>The program you have associated with .doc type files within your Windows settings determines the program used upon clicking <span class="span_2">Create Word Document</span>. To change the program associated with .doc type files, browse for a .doc file from My Computer, right click on the file and select properties. From the General tab click <span class="span_2">Change</span> next to <span class="span_2">Opens with</span> and select from the drop-down list of choices. </p>
        <p>If <span class="span_2">Merge to Document</span> is launched from the results of a search, then one large document is created with page breaks separating the results for each profile included in the search. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span><span> Windows Users:</span> Users need to be granted permission to print document templates by the database administrator. Make changes in a Primary-Sync database or a Non-Sync activated database. Also, depending upon your Internet Explorer settings, you may be prompted for User Login Authentication information before launching the merged document. This only happens on a very specific setup. To remove this prompt, take the following steps within the Internet Explorer settings: </p>
        <p>1) Go to <span>Tools|Internet Options|Security.</span> </p>
        <p>2) Click <span>Local Intranet.</span> </p>
        <p>3) Click <span>Sites</span>. </p>
        <p>4) Click <span>Advanced</span>. </p>
        <p>5) Add your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> URL to the Intranet zone (e.g. http://www.xxxxxxx). </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Create a Mailer</h3>
        <p class="p_2">Create Mailers: </p>
        <p class="p_2">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 5 Putting Profiles to Work for You/Putting Profiles to Work for_2.jpg" style="height: 60px;width: 418px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Whether printing a single letter from within a profile, or a large group of letters from the results of a query, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> makes it easy to track mailings to your clients. This icon automatically creates a mailer record for every customer included in the query results. Whether it’s one result or 500 results, a unique mailer record is attached to each profile for historical purposes. The mailers can be viewed from within the client profile by clicking the activities tab, and can also be queried and printed from the Activities Manager by date or subject.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Merge to Email">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Merge to Email </h2>

            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 5 Putting Profiles to Work for You/Putting Profiles to Work for_1.png" style="height: 147px;width: 154px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Before you can use Merge to Email in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, some setup is required. SMTP is a standard protocol (language) used for sending email on the Internet. Every mail server is capable of handling SMTP email. Your agency can utilize this SMTP feature providing it has the proper mail server configuration. A User Login stores the details necessary to send email via SMTP and you can setup with these settings either through the email settings link in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, by going to <span>Tools|My Login,</span> or by the database administrator in your User Login record in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
        <p><span>Set Up </span><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span><span> with Mail Server’s SMTP Settings</span>
        </p>
        <p>Click <span class="span_2">Merge to Email</span> from within any profile to launch the email composition screen. From this email screen click the <span class="span_2">Settings</span> link or go to <span>Tools|My Login</span> on menu bar. </p>
        <p class="p_2">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 5 Putting Profiles to Work for You/Putting Profiles to Work for_3.jpg" style="height: 293px;width: 594px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses the SMTP (Simple Messaging Text Protocol) to send emails. Complete the <span class="span_2">User Login SMTP Settings </span>obtained from the entity responsible for maintaining your mail server (ISP). </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">From E-Mail Address:</span> Enter the email address for the user login you are setting up. The address entered here appears as the from address for all emails sent from this user. If you wish to change this address frequently, do so at the email level when you are sending it out.</p>
        <p>In the <span class="span_2">From E-Mail</span> field, if you type <span>joyce@sabre.com</span> and a message is sent, you see the From field saying <span>joyce@sabre.com</span>. Some people prefer it to look like this instead, <span>Joyce Smith</span>. To have it appear like this, type <span>Joyce </span><span>Smith&lt;joyce@sabre.com&gt;</span> instead of just <span>joyce@sabre.com</span>. You can also use your company name or department name; for example, <span>Travel With the Stars&lt;sales@TWTS.com&gt; </span>or <span>Star Travel Marketing&lt;sales@TWTS.com&gt;.</span></p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP):</span> Enter the outgoing mail server name determined in your steps above. Examples: mail.domainname.com, smtp.domainname.com, or gomail.wspan.com).</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Port:</span> This setting defines the TCP/IP port which your email application listens on for incoming mail. If left blank, this setting uses port 25 by default, which is the Internet standard for receiving SMTP mail. In some situations, you may have chosen to move the SMTP service to another port. Perhaps you already have a service on port 25, and you do not want the services to conflict over the port assignment. In such a case, enter the port <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> should use. </p>
        <p>The default port for encrypted connections is 465 and unencrypted is 25. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> will automatically set the port to these defaults when choosing a Secure Connection setting. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Authentication Type:</span> Set to <span class="span_2">Default</span>, a setting used to authenticate your connection to the SMTP mail server by forcing a USER name and password. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">None</span>: If your agency is hosting your own email server and the network login has been configured to handle the authentication to the SMTP Server automatically, set this field to <span class="span_2">None. </span></p>
        <p><span class="span_2">E-Mail Account Login and Password:</span> Use when <span class="span_2">Login Type</span> is set to <span class="span_2">Default. </span>Enter your E-Mail account login and password here.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Secure Connection:</span> <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Merge to Email feature supports SSL/TLS secure connections. A drop-down enables you to select from four options: None, TLS (if available), TLS, and SSL. </p>
        <p>The type of connection you select is determined by the type of security supported by your email provider or Internet Service Provider (ISP). Please contact your ISP to find out which setting is correct for your email account.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">SSL:</span> Use SSL for encrypting email sent via SMTP.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">TLS:</span> Use TLS for encrypting email sent via SMTP. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">TLS, if available:</span> Attempt to use TLS for encrypting email sent via SMTP. If the server does not support TLS, SSL will be attempted instead.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">None: </span>You do not wish encrypt your email(s) or your SMTP server does not support SSL/TLS.</p>
        <p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) is quickly becoming the common standard for encrypting emails. </p>
        <p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor to TLS. There are very few differences between SSL and TLS. TLS's encryption is a little stronger, however, both types are almost identical, with only minor technical differences in the way the email is encrypted and transmitted.</p>
        <p>The default port for encrypted connections is 465 and unencrypted is 25. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> will automatically set the port to these defaults when choosing a Secure Connection setting. Here are some settings for common ISP’s:</p>

        <h3 class="Heading3">Using Merge to E-Mail</h3>
        <p>Merge to Email can be launched 1) From the results of a search for multiple profiles using <span class="span_2">Simple Search </span>or <span class="span_2">Advanced Search;</span> or 2) From within a single profile by clicking the action gear next to the client’s name in the Profile Manager or within a client profile by clicking <span class="span_2">Merge to Email </span>on the toolbar. </p>
        <p>E-Mail addresses are kept in the communication entry area found in the general information link of all types of profiles. </p>
        <h4>Using Merge to E-Mail from the results of a search</h4>
        <p class="ListParagraph_1">When merging information into an email, merge the information to multiple emails from the search results area by clicking <span class="span_2">Merge To Labels </span>on the <span class="span_2">Menu Options</span> drop-down. </p>

        <p>**<span class="span_2">All (Profile and Traveler)</span> - this option sends to all addresses in the profile that meet the query criteria. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">**Profile (If none, then Primary Traveler)</span> - this option sends to the Profile-level email address, if there is one. If there isn't, then it will use the e-mail address of the Primary Traveler. </p>
        <p>**<span class="span_2">Traveler (If none, then Profile)</span> - this means that if no Traveler has an e-mail address that meets the query criteria, then e-mail is sent to the Profile address or addresses that meet the criteria. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">**Traveler Only</span> - looks only for traveler e-mail addresses based on matching query criteria. This option merges to all Traveler e-mail addresses that meet the criteria. If there isn't one, then nothing is sent. </p>
        <p><span>Include Only Primary E-mail</span>: This box is checked by default. For any of the above options, if this box is checked, only the Primary E-mail address (either Traveler, Profile, or both, depending on the option chosen) will be sent to. If it's unchecked, then all e-mails, primary or non-primary, that meet the criteria will be used. </p>

If more than one email exists within the profile, a grid appears allowing you to select the desired emails you would like to send to. </p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Preparing Emails to Send</h4>
        <p>For each email being sent, notice the <span class="span_2">Profile Name, Address, Phone </span>and <span class="span_2">Fax Numbers. </span>To get to other emails in the series, use the navigation buttons, <span class="span_2">First, Previous, Next, </span>and<span class="span_2"> Last</span>. Any data entered into the first email entry screen appears automatically in the other emails in the series.</p>
        <p><span>To:</span> Includes each individual email address matching your criteria.</p>
        <p><span>Subject:</span> Type the subject of the email. Any email sent MUST have a subject.</p>
        <p><span>CC:</span> Enter any email that you want to receive a copy of this email. (Remember, this appears automatically in the other emails in the series.)</p>
        <p><span>Priority:</span> Select a priority label from the drop-down menu of <span class="span_2">Highest, High, Normal, Low </span>and<span class="span_2"> Lowest</span>.</p>
        <p><span>Mode</span>: From the drop-down, select, <span class="span_2">Plain Text or HTML. </span>If you select <span class="span_2">HTML, </span>two tabs appear, one labeled <span class="span_2">Compose </span>and one labeled <span class="span_2">HTML</span>. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Use the Compose tab to type and format your HTML without knowing how to code HTML. A formatting toolbar is included that makes formatting your text, inserting links, pictures and tables very easy. Use the HTML tab if you have Raw HTML that you would like to paste into the email. Anything entered into the Compose tab will then be formatted in raw HTML upon clicking the HTML tab. Anything entered into the HTML tab will then be formatted upon clicking the Compose tab. </p>
        <p>Use the Preview button to preview the email message prior to sending. Use the Load Template button to select and load a Document Template set up in <span>Tools|Settings|Document Templates</span>. <span>Please note</span> that Document Templates have been enhanced to allow formatting in HTML as well, but this formatting is only included when the template is launched via Merge to Email. All Templates launched through the Merge to Doc Template feature are converted to Plain Text upon converting to MS Word.</p>
        <p><span>Insert Field/Load Template:</span> Complete your message by using any of the global document templates setup by the database administrator in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Use <span>Load Doc Template</span> to select from a listing of global templates or use the<span> Insert Fields</span> to insert merge fields in combination with free-flow text.</p>
        <p><span>Tip:</span> If you select <span>Salutation|Courtesy Title Last Name, </span>or<span> Salutation|First Name, </span>or<span> Salutation|Name</span> as a merge field, the | character included in the Salutation means that if the Salutation field is not completed within one of the resulting profiles, then for just that profile, you want it to use the merge field following the |. For any of the name field merge fields, if the email is linked to a traveler, then the traveler’s name fields will be merged. If the email is not linked to a traveler, then the profile name fields will be merged. </p>
        <p><span>Preview: </span>This option allows you to preview message in its formatted state before sending. </p>
        <p><span>Attachments: </span>Add an attachment to email by clicking <span class="span_2">Browse </span>to locate the attachment, and then <span class="span_2">Attach. </span></p>
        <p><span>Mailer:</span> To keep a history of any emails sent, be sure to create a <span class="span_2">Mailer</span> record by clicking on the <span class="span_2">Mailer </span>link. These mailers then create a history within each profile whenever an email is sent.</p>
        <p><span>Mail Date/Time:</span> By default, the date and time are auto-filled. These can be changed manually by using the drop-downs.</p>
        <p><span>Subject: </span>Choose a subject for the mailer from the drop-down menu with items setup by the database administrator in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. By choosing from the drop-downs, consistency is assured for reporting and querying purposes.</p>
        <p><span>Body: </span>By default, the mailer retains a copy of the body of the email.</p>
        <p>Click <span class="span_2">OK </span>to save.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Sent Emails</h4>
        <p>All emails sent from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> create an email job at your SMTP server which can be monitored by clicking the <span class="span_2">All Email Jobs</span> link. This link allows you to monitor jobs that have not yet been completed to view the status. If you want to cancel an email job before it is finished, you can do so by clicking the <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> link next to the job. <span class="span_2">Purge Inactive</span> then deletes any jobs from the listing once they have been cancelled.

        <h4 class="Heading4">Using Merge to File</h4>
        <p>1) The first step in using the Merge to File feature is to search in the Profile, Activity, or Res Card Manager to find the list of records to be included in the ASCII export.</p>
        <p>2) Designate the fields to include within the file for each record in your results. The fields to include are based upon the current columns displayed within your query results. To change the fields to include, use <span class="span_2">Select Columns</span> to add or remove the fields within columns as desired.</p>
        <p>3) Designate the sort order to include within the file for each record. This sorting within the ASCII export is determined by the current sorting of the current query results. To change the sorting, use <span class="span_2">Sort by Columns</span> to setup to three levels of sorting criteria.</p>
        <p>4) Click <span class="span_2">Merge To Labels </span>on the <span class="span_2">Menu Options</span> drop-down to run the export. A dialog box appears prompting you for the following information: </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><span>File Name:</span> Enter the name to assign the file. (No need to enter the drive, directory or file extension as you are prompted for that information later.) </p>
        <p><span>Include Field Name:</span> This is checked by default and determines whether field headers describing the fields of data in each record are included in the file. </p>
        <p><span>ASCII File Type:</span> Select either <span class="span_2">Comma delimited</span> or <span class="span_2">Tab delimited</span>. This character separates each field included within each record in the file. </p>
        <p><span>Results to Merge: </span>If you want to include all entries in the result screen, click <span class="span_2">All Results in Current Manager. </span>If you want to pick specific entries to include in the file and have clicked on these entries in the result screen before you merged to file, click <span class="span_2">Selected Results in Current Manager</span> and <span class="span_2">Generate Labels.</span></p>
        <p>5) Click <span class="span_2">Create Mailer</span> to include a record in clients’ profile automatically that their names were included in the file. We suggest you always create a mailer so you can track what was sent to a client or on behalf of a client.</p>

        <p>Select a subject and type a description of mailing in remarks area if desired.</p>
        <p>6) Click <span class="span_2">Export</span> to begin the export process. You are prompted with the option of opening the file or saving it to your computer. If you choose to save it to your computer, a window appears giving you the ability to set the file extension, and select the drive and directory where you would like to save the file. If you choose to open the file, you are prompted with a listing of program choices to view the data. </p>
        <p><span>Note: </span>In order to use this feature, permission must be granted by the database administrator.</p>

        <p>No more multiple entries or databases! <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides you with the ability to move customer information (maintained in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profiles) to your reservation system's PNR. Watch your marketing database grow as you become more efficient in collecting and using the database information to build PNR’s. You'll be surprised at how quickly existing customer information gets updated, and how quickly new customer information gets added when you use <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> as the source for building PNR’s. Also, watch your customer loyalty grow as you quickly access customer information instead of asking for the same information over and over again. </p>
        <p>Any field captured in a client profile can be formatted for your CRS PNR. This is done via a <span class="span_2">PNR Rule</span>. PNR Rules are maintained through the Settings menu. In addition to client profile fields, the Merge to PNR feature also includes any entries captured within <span class="span_2">PNR Entry tables</span>. PNR Entry tables are stored at four levels - the Branch level, the Agent level, the Client Profile level and the Client Traveler level. </p>
        <p>This means you have complete flexibility on the amount of information you would like automatically formatted for a PNR while working in a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile. Although all PNR Entries captured at any level are included within the Merge to PNR feature, at this time you can only update these PNR Entries within <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> at the Agent and Profile levels. </p>
        <p class="p_2">Using the Merge to PNR Feature</p>
        <p>Before you use the Merge to PNR feature there is a one-time file download (GDS API Files) that must be done on the user’s workstation. <span>Note: </span>The user must have administrative rights on the computer to download and run this file. Click here for complete instructions for each GDS.</p>

        <h4 class="Heading4">Using Merge to PNR</h4>
        <p>1) Open a PNR on your computer. You may start checking availability and actually have a reservation ready in the PNR, but when it is time to add client name and address information, toggle into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. (Some agencies like to start in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, Merge to PNR, and then toggle into the PNR to check availability, and create reservation.)</p>
        <p>2) Search to find the client’s profile. To Merge to PNR from the Results Screen, click the action menu icon (gear) in Profile Manager, and <span class="span_2">Merge to PNR.</span></p>

Information on this screen can be modified, but does not permanently update your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile.</p>
        <p>6) Pressing <span class="span_2">Send to PNR</span> does the following depending on your CRS: </p>
        <p><span>Sabre Red Workspace, APS, Vista, and Apollo/Galileo Users:</span> When clicking Finish, the previewed information is pasted into your current PNR. If this occurs successfully, a confirming message appears. Use your normal Windows command (&lt;Alt+Tab&gt;) to toggle into your CRS, hit Display All and view the updated PNR. </p>
        <p><span>Amadeus Users:</span> The PNR Import for Amadeus takes air, car, hotel and rail segments included in an Amadeus PNR and imports them into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card reservation records. Amadeus uses the Amadeus Selling Platform (see the section about the traditional command pages in Amadeus) as you’ll need that to work with merge/import. If you are on terminal services and CB is not then use the clipboard. </p>
        <p>Sabre Red Workspace Users: An API is the tool that ClientBase uses to connect to the Sabre Host.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">In order for PNRfeatures to work with Sabre Red Workstation (classic Sabre) you must enable the Sabre Emulator API emulator within Sabre Red.</p>

        <p>Sabre Red 360 Users: Installing Active X Controls for PNR features is no longer necessary, however you will need to access from within Sabre Red 360 Platform to use these features.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Launch on SR360 from the black toolbar, select <b>Tools &gt; Customer Management &gt; ClientBase Online.</b></p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p><span>Worldspan Users: </span>If characters to be pasted exceed 1000 characters, then copy to clipboard is broken into multiple packets. Upon clicking <span class="span_2">Send to PNR</span>, the system prompts with a message, <span class="span_2">1 of X of the PNR information is ready for pasting</span>. At this point the user must toggle to Worldspan and paste the first packet of information. If there are more packets, than the user must toggle back to <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, click <span class="span_2">OK</span>, and paste the remaining packets.</p>
        <p><span>Nexion Users:</span> Nexion offers an InternetView connection to the GDS's. Since it is Internet based, Merge to PNR via clipboard is the only GDS related function of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> that works with it. </p>

        <p>If you need to change the GDS platform with which you are working, click the <span class="span_2">GDS Selection</span> link. You are prompted to download a new applet if applicable. </p>
        <p class="p_2">Additional Entries Link </p>
        <p>Within each PNR Entry or PNR Rule that is set to <span class="span_2">Always Move</span>, an option is included called "Display on Selection Screen". The PNR Selection Screen is the screen that appears when you use the Merge to PNR feature and allows you to select the specific profile data to be included and sent to the current PNR. For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this <span class="span_2">Display on Selection Screen</span> can be unchecked so that the Selection Screen is less complicated for the agent to review. Any of these entries that have not been designated to display on the selection screen can be viewed, if desired, by clicking <span class="span_2">Additional Entries</span>.</p>
