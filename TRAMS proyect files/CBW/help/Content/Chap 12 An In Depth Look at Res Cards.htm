        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As your agency implements <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and begins reaping the rewards of improved customer relationships and effective marketing programs, your leisure travel sales should start increasing. To help better manage this increasing volume of business and track the leads generated by your marketing programs, the <span class="span_2">Res Card</span> has been created. Think of the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card as a home for the many details involved in planning each and every trip for customers and as a tool that helps manage the entire trip planning process. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 12 An In-Depth Look at Res Cards/An In Depth Look at Res Cards.jpg" style="height: 279px;width: 388px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Res%20Cards.16.1.01.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <br />Regardless of the technology your agents use or don’t use, regardless of your niche or type of business, regardless of how long your agents have been in the business, there are certain fundamental components involved in the <span class="span_2">trip planning process</span>. The <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card has been designed to help agents through each process with the objective of making agents more efficient and effective. In the past, agents may have concentrated more of their attention on just the booking process, but with the advent of airline commission caps, there has been a new emphasis on leisure bookings and a greater need to manage these leisure sales. </p>
        <p>The Res Card feature in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides a perfect tool to integrate all processes in trip planning. By setting up an "electronic" Res Card, an agent can document the client’s first call by creating a <span class="span_2">Res Card</span> and scheduling a follow-up call (listed on the daily to-do list) with a <span class="span_2">reminder. </span>Once the customer is considering the trip, the agent can capture details of reservations and print out client quotes or itineraries. By using the Live Connect feature in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, agents have the ability to book reservations via on-line booking engines and then pull all that reservation detail back into the Res Card. </p>
        <p>When the client books the trip, the agent produces invoices and trip statements, while tracking invoiced and uninvoiced balances. Additional notes and reminders can be created to remind an agent of a final payment date or a document confirmation. When the customer returns home, the agent can document his remarks and suggestions. Because all client trip data is in one localized area, reports such as Final Payment, Vendor Booking and Service Provider Activity can be produced for Res Cards in all stages of implementation of the trip planning process. </p>
        <p>As <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> shares a database with <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>, the invoices generated from the Res Card automatically become part of the invoices shared with <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>. Invoices generated through the Res Card maintain their own numbering system, separate from the numbering system of invoices generated through interface.</p>
        <p>Since each Res Card represents one trip, customers are likely to have multiple Res Cards in their profiles at any one time in the <span class="span_2">Res Card </span>tab. Depending on your agency’s needs, enter as much or as little trip information on each Res Card as desired. When talking with clients and vendors, get in the habit of entering the information directly into the Res Card rather than jotting the notes on paper and then transferring the information into the computer. What a time saver this is! Click the <span class="span_2">Res Card </span>tab in the client profile to find a summary of the Res Cards created for this client, with each Res Card representing a different trip for the customer. </p>

        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Res Card, 4 Ways to Create">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Four Ways to Create a New Res Card</h3>
        <p>There are 4 ways to create a new Res Card:</p>
        <p>1) Create a reservation card by highlighting the customer profile in the results screen of the profile manager, and clicking the toolbar Res Card icon. Also create a Res Card anywhere inside the profile, as well, by clicking the toolbar Res Card icon. </p>
        <p>2) In the Res Card tab in the client’s Profile, click <span class="span_2">Add</span>. To modify or delete an existing card, highlight the card and click <span class="span_2">Modify </span>or <span class="span_2">Delete</span>.</p>
        <p>3) Copy an entire Res Card from one profile to another. Most of the data captured within the Res Card is copied including general Res Card information, reservation records and agent remarks. The data that does not copy includes the Res Card create date, invoices, activities, client feedback about trip, profile-specific information (such as the bill to/ship to addresses) and traveler related fields (such as traveler names, seat assignments, ticket numbers, etc). </p>
        <p>To copy an entire Res Card, simply highlight the one to copy (do not open the Res Card) and click <span class="span_2">Copy</span>. Next, close the profile, and retrieve or create the profile you want to copy to, select the Res Card tab and click <span class="span_2">Paste</span>.</p>
        <p>4) Need to create a Res Card quickly on the fly? Click the Res Card icon the toolbar and after entering Query data, decide what profile the record should be associated with. Be careful when creating a Res Card like this, however, or you may end up creating it for the wrong client. As every Res Card must be attached to a profile, the system defaults the current profile highlighted in the current manager. If you make an error though and attach the Res Card to the wrong profile, re-associate the record with the correct one by typing a portion of the client name (Last/First) in the Res Card <span class="span_2">Prepared For</span> field, and clicking the drop-down arrow to get a listing of matching profiles from which to select. &#160;</p>

        <p><span>**Status:</span> Enter the status of the trip from the drop-down menu. Choices are <span class="span_2">Active, Departed, or Cancelled</span>. (This area needs to be updated when the trip is in a different status.) All Res Cards created with an <span class="span_2">Active</span> raise an indicator icon when retrieving the profile. This way, whenever agents are viewing the profile, they are aware that an active Res Card exists.</p>
        <p><span>Reservation Cycle:</span> Enter where the trip is in the reservation cycle from the drop-down menu. Default choices are <span class="span_2">Lead, Booked, Under Deposit, Paid-In-Full, Returned From Trip</span>, or customize the default list for the user-defined <span class="span_2">Reservation Cycle</span> field by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Reservation Cycle</span>. By faithfully changing the status of the reservation cycle, print out reports to view what reservation cards are in each reservation cycle per agent.</p>

The user definable Destinations also include the ability to be linked to one of the hard coded Regions. Upon creating a Res Card, if the Region field is completed first then upon selecting a Destination the drop-down listing will only include a subset of those Destinations linked to that Region. If Allow Freeflow is not checked (forcing the users to select from the drop down listing) then multiple Destinations can selected and inserted into one Res Card. </p>
        <p><span>Trip Start Date/Trip End Date: </span>Enter trip dates here for reference, but this field is not required and not suggested for use. When dates are entered into a reservation, these date fields are updated automatically by the reservation dates and become read-only.</p>
        <p><span>Addresses:</span> The client ship to and bill to addresses default to addresses setup in the client profile. Upon creating a new Res Card, the user profile address defaults to being checked, so unless the check is removed, any changes to the profile address automatically updates the corresponding Res Card address. To manually change an address, uncheck the appropriate box (not suggested, as if you update the profile you’ll have a permanent address change and the Res Card will automatically be changed). </p>
        <p><span>Travelers:</span> Identify the travelers traveling on this trip by clicking <span class="span_2">Travelers</span> at the top of the field.

        <p>There are four other ways (besides copying mentioned above) in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to add data to a Res Card including manual entry, Live Connect, Import from PNR, and Pull From Inventory. All methods are outlined below and begin by creating a new reservation by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. </p>
        <p>A reservation input screen is entered containing two sections - <span>Reservation </span>(top) and <span>Service Provider </span>(bottom). The <span>Reservation </span>section contains 8 tabs - <span class="span_2">General</span> (to enter reservation details); <span class="span_2">More Taxes </span>(to enter tax information); <span class="span_2">Expanded Fare Info</span> (to enter markups/discounts you don’t want broken out on the customer invoice, and for Fare Savings info to be collected in TBO); <span class="span_2">Payment Due Date </span>(to enter deposit and final payment dates and create a reminder for each)<span class="span_2">;</span> <span class="span_2">Itin/Invoice Remarks</span> (to enter free-flowing itinerary/invoice remarks); <span class="span_2">Agent Remarks</span> (to enter free-flowing agent remarks); <span class="span_2">More Fields </span>(customizable fields designed to capture data that is unique to your agency's or clients' needs); and <span class="span_2">Edit History </span>(provides you with a history of the changes users make to reservations). </p>
        <p>Each of these tabs can be viewed from the 6 Service Provider tabs below (General, Itinerary, Traveler Details, Itin/Invoice Remarks, Agent Remarks, and Allocated Pricing).</p>

        </p>
        <p><span>Date Reserved:</span> Enter the date this booking is reserved. By clicking the down arrow, select a date by double-clicking the desired day from the calendar.</p>
        <p><span>**Booking Status:</span> A drop-down list of <span class="span_2">Confirmed, Cancelled </span>and<span class="span_2"> Quoted </span>are available choices. The Confirmation Status is not free-flow and cannot be left blank, as the entry selected has an impact on the reservation total included in the Res Card balances at the top of a Res Card. Reservations with a status of <span class="span_2">Confirmed </span>increase the reservation total and can be invoiced and included on trip statements. <span>Reservations with a status of </span><span class="span_2">Quoted</span><span> do not increase the reservation total, and cannot be invoiced and do not appear on trip statements, although can be included in all formats of the </span><span class="span_2">Proposal </span><span>and </span><span class="span_2">Itinerary</span><span>.</span> Reservations with a status of <span class="span_2">Cancelled</span> do not increase the reservation total and cannot be invoiced nor do they appear on <span class="span_2">Proposal, Itineraries </span>or <span class="span_2">Trip Statements</span>. </p>
        <p><span>**Vendor:</span> Enter the vendor for this booking by entering the first two or three letters of the vendor’s name and then clicking the desired name from the drop-down menu. If the vendor is not in the menu, you receive a message, “No matching profiles.” Create a vendor profile by going to <span>File|New|Vendor Profile</span> from File Menu Items at the top of your screen. </p>
        <p>To go to the vendor profile from a reservation, click the <span class="span_2">Go To Profile</span> button next to the vendor (it’s the 2 heads with the red arrow icon to the right of the field), and the system moves you into the corresponding vendor profile for review. Easily access your vendor details such as phone numbers, key contacts, client remarks etc. Upon closing the vendor profile, the system returns you back to the reservation record. </p>
        <p><span>Note: </span>You have ability to automatically launch the Live Connect screen when a vendor linked to a Live Connect provider is selected within a Res Card reservation. This feature can be enabled/ disabled by going to <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Default Field Values for Res Cards|Reservations</span> and removing the check in the setting called <span class="span_2">Automatically launch Live Connect for Live Connect Vendors.</span></p>
        <p><span>**Travel Category:</span> Enter the travel category for this booking by clicking the drop-down menu. This field automatically defaults by setting the default Travel Category within the vendor profile. If there is more than one Travel Category assigned to the vendor profile, the Travel Category defaults to the first Travel Category in the list for that vendor. If there is no Travel Category assigned to the vendor profile, the reservation defaults to the Travel Category of <span class="span_2">Cruise</span>.<span class="span_5"> (</span>This field automatically creates a default Travel Type for this reservation that is used when invoicing to <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>.)</p>

        <p><span>Inventory:</span> Click the <span class="span_2">Inventory</span> icon to connect to a database of inventory while working in the Res Card. To query inventory for a particular client's trip, create a res card for that client from the res card main screen, click <span class="span_2">Inventory. </span>Or from the <span class="span_2">Reservation Tab,</span> click <span class="span_2">Add, </span>set the Travel Category, and click <span class="span_2">Inventory</span>. A Level 2 Inventory Query screen appears to query your database of inventory based upon the travel needs of the client. For complete directions on creating and using inventory, please refer to the section <span class="span_2">Creating and Using Inventory.</span></p>
        <p><span>Group ID/Rate Code: </span>These fields can be used to track details of group cruise contracts. If these fields are completed on an inventory record, they will be populated on the reservation when an inventory record is pulled in. Users can also enter data in these fields manually. These fields have also been added to Res Card Reports and to the Res Card Level Two and Level Three Query filters. </p>

        <p><span>Invoiced out of CB:</span> If you use the PNR Import feature, there are certain cases where reservation data captured in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> may have been invoiced outside, for example, invoiced through the GDS. So that these types of reservations are not invoiced twice in error (once out of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, then again in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>), this checkbox updates the Res Card balances at the top accordingly. Res Card balances at the top of a Res Card remain the same unless a reservation exists that has been designated as <span class="span_2">Invoiced out of CB+</span>. If a reservation exists with the designation of <span class="span_2">Invoiced out of CB+,</span> then the Res Card balances reflect <span class="span_2">Res Total, Invoiced in CB+, Invoiced out of CB+, </span>and<span class="span_2"> Balance</span>. </p>
        <p>Set up default settings for this area in <span>Global Default|Default Field Values for Res Cards. </span>All new reservations imported using PNR Import have the <span class="span_2">Invoiced outside of CB+</span> checked. Any reservations entered by hand or through Live Connect do not default to being checked, but in either case the default can be overwritten. Any reservations designated as <span class="span_2">Invoiced out of CB+</span> do not appear as an option for invoicing through <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, but can be included on the invoice summary as part of the <span class="span_2">Prior Invoiced</span> totals. These reservations can also be included on all formats of the print itinerary feature.</p>

        <p><span>Issued Through ARC:</span> If you use the import PNR feature in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> (see chapter on <span class="span_2">An In-Depth Look at PNR Import</span>), you can capture ARC type transactions. Notice when this box is checked, how an airline field appears before the vendor field in the reservation header. When an air travel category is selected in the service provider portion of the reservation, a validating carrier, in addition to a vendor is captured and all pricing is captured within the traveler details tab, as pricing and ticket information is at the traveler level. </p>

If you begin to capture this setting in your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Cards, then you are able to Query your database of Res Cards for reservations that have been classified as <span class="span_2">Domestic, International </span>or<span class="span_2"> TransBorder</span>, as this field has been added as a filter to Level 2 and Level 3 Queries in Profile Manager and Level 2 Query in Res Card Manager. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span><span> Subscribers:</span> This field is captured within the <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> booking upon invoicing. Since the TBO invoice booking does not allow this field to be blank, if the field is left blank within the reservation record, the field defaults to <span class="span_2">Domestic</span> in TBO upon invoicing.</p>
        <p><span>Confirmation #:</span> Enter the confirmation number for this booking.</p>
        <p><span>Record Locator:</span> Enter a record locator number if available.</p>
        <p><span>Promo ID:</span> This field is freeflow and can be used to capture a specific product or promotional code for this reservation. This field can also be passed to an on-line booking engine as it has also been added to the Live Connect selection screen for including in the post of information sent to an on-line booking site.</p>
        <p><span>Booking Method:</span> Enter the method of the booking from the drop-down menu.

        <h4>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Multiple Currencies">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Handling Multiple Currencies</h4>
        <p>When handling multiple currencies, reservations can be tracked in the agency's currency or reservations can be tracked in the foreign (vendor) currency. The setting <span class="span_2">By Default Track Res Card Balances In</span>" under <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Currency Setup </span>can be setup as the default. This is simply a default and can be overridden per Res Card. </p>
        <p>A <span class="span_2">Multi Currency</span> tab added to the Res Card also contains this <span class="span_2">Track Res Card Balances In</span> setting in order to update Res Card balances on a one-by-one basis. <br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 12 An In-Depth Look at Res Cards/An In Depth Look at Res Cards_14.jpg" style="height: 305px;width: 594px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Res%20Cards.16.1.17.jpg" class="img_1" /></p>
        <p>
            <br />Res Card balances entered prior to version 3.6 will remain in the Agency Currency unless modified individually.) New reservations with multiple currencies are also tracked in Agency Currency until the setting is changed in Global Defaults or the setting is changed per Res Card under the Multi Currency tab. </p>
        <p>Although Res Card balance tracking can be changed from Agency Currency to Foreign Currency and vice versa, change will only occur if Res Card is not invoiced. If the Res Card is already invoiced, this setting under the <span class="span_2">Multi Currency</span> tab is disabled. If changing from Agency Currency to Foreign Currency, the system checks to see if the record contains Markup/Discounts and if so prompts, <span class="span_2">Markup/Discounts exist and are not supported when balances are tracked in the Foreign Currency. Continuing will clear any Markup/Discounts entered. Continue? Yes/No</span>." </p>
        <p>When tracking Res Card balances in Foreign Currency, itemization can now be captured. Itemization is captured in the reservation's currency. If itemization is captured and user changes the selected currency, user is prompted <span class="span_2">Changing the Reservation Currency will clear all Itemization details. Do you want to continue? Yes/No.</span> Since itemization cannot be captured when Res Card balances are tracked in Agency Currency, if changing Res Card from Foreign Currency to Agency Currency the system checks to see if Itemization exists and if so prompts <span class="span_2">Itemization exists. Currency cannot be converted at the itemization level. Continuing will clear all itemization details. Continue? Yes/No.</span></p>
        <p><span class="span_6">If agency chooses to continue to track reservation totals in the agency's currency</span>, an invoice setting gives the options of showing traveler pricing for each reservation in Agency, Vendor and/or Client currency on an invoice. Select <span>Utilities|Branch</span> and then click <span class="span_2">Format Settings</span> under Invoice Settings. A Multi-Currency section is available for selection with the options of <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency, Show Vendor Currency and Show Client Currency</span>. All three or any combination of these settings may be selected; therefore, check the box or boxes of the currencies that should appear for pricing on an invoice. These settings are only used when Track Res Card Balances is set to Agency Currency.</p>
        <p><span>Example:</span> An agency located in Canada booked a cruise with a US vendor. In the Multiple Currency screen the Vendor currency was entered as $1500 US dollars. The Agency Currency was entered as $1400 Canadian dollars. If the <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency</span> option was checked, only the Canadian dollars appear under pricing when the invoice is generated. If both <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency</span> and <span class="span_2">Show Vendor Currency</span> options were checked, pricing appears in both Canadian dollars and US dollars. If the client paid for the reservation in a different currency (i.e. Euros) and that amount was entered as the Client Currency on the Multiple Currency screen and all three options where checked, pricing would appear in all three currencies.</p>
        <p><span class="span_7">If agency chooses to track reservation totals in the foreign currency,</span> when tracking balances in Foreign currency there is no longer a Multi Currency screen. Each reservation is entered in the currency it was booked in by clicking the Currency drop-down and selecting the correct currency code. Once the currency code is chosen the currency rate is displayed. Currency rates are based on the Currency Setup in Global Defaults but can be changed at the time of booking if needed. However, if ARC/BSP is checked, the currency must remain in the agency's currency and the Currency field is disabled. </p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> When Commission GST rate is changed by the user, the Client GST rate is no longer also updated. Similarly, when the Client GST rate is changed by the user, Commission GST rate is no longer also updated. Place of supply rules for GST rates are still in effect when a reservation is created.</p>
        <p>For each reservation, the Reservation Totals summary on the right side of the screen shows the currency code for all foreign currency bookings. The Res Card totals in the Res Card Header will summarize all balances with one line per currency. The first two currencies are displayed; however, if more lines exist, click the button next to the Res Card header to view all. Reservation totals at the bottom of the Res Card show the balance of the Selected Reservation in the currency it was booked along with the Currency Code. The balances displayed for All Confirmed Reservations summarize all reservations booked in the agency's currency. Click the button next to the Reservation totals at the bottom of the Res Card to view all Reservation totals. </p>
        <p><span class="span_7">Invoicing Multi Currency</span><span>:</span> On the invoicing screen, each reservation appears in the currency the reservation was booked in along with the conversion rate. Conversion rate can be changed if needed. When printing all invoices, each reservation appears on the invoice in the currency it was booked in. All reservations are then totaled per currency and appear at the bottom of the invoice, one box of totals per currency. Client payments are printed on the invoice in the reservation's currency. If agency also uses <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> software, client credit card payments are saved in TBO in the agency's currency. Client payments entered as CC Merchant, Debit Card, Check and Cash payments are not saved in TBO and need to be handled in the back office by the bookkeeper.&#160; </p>
        <p><span>Note:</span><span>&#160; </span>Remember once the res card has been invoiced, the multi currency option cannot be changed.&#160; You will need to void all invoices if you need to make a change the option on how to track balances . </p>

        </ul>
        <p>Default settings for this area can be set up in <span>Global Default|Default Field Values for Res Cards</span>. </p>
        <p><span>Travel Category:</span> This field is not mandatory when entering itemized amounts, nor does it print on the invoice. (If insurance is captured as part of the itemization, then the insurance waiver prompting at time of invoice does not appear. Insurance waiver prompting now looks for a reservation, service provider or itemization record with a travel category of insurance to determine if the prompt should appear or not. Insurance waiver prompting is established under Global Defaults.)</p>
        <p>After filling in the fields to break out itemized totals, <span class="span_2">Insert </span>updates the data screen below with the new traveler information; <span class="span_2">Update </span>modifies the data screen below with updated traveler information; <span class="span_2">Delete</span> eliminates a highlighted entry, and <span class="span_2">New </span>provides blank data entry fields for entering free-flow new traveler information.

        <p>The default <span class="span_2">City Code</span> table, used within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card reservations, is a user defined drop-down table that can be edited by the user. To update the city codes that <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> comes defaulted with, either go to<span> Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields </span>or click the blue field link for city within a Res Card reservation record.

        </p>
        <p>Designate which taxes go to which tax fields when invoicing from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Tax defaults for up to 4 taxes, may be setup under <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Tax and Commission</span>. If desired, for each tax field, specify the two-letter tax Identifiers of the taxes. If you have more than one Tax ID, separate them by a comma. The commission rate for vendors used in reservations is defaulting to the vendor commission field in the <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> vendor profile. If the vendor default commission in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> is blank, then the commission defaults to the amount entered in the field called <span class="span_2">Comm Rate</span> under <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Tax and Commission</span>.</p>
        <p>When you enter the amount of tax for the reservation and have not used the tax table, the total amount of the tax appears in the Tax 1 Field in the More Taxes tab. If you want to separate the taxes, use the More Taxes table and enter the amount of each separate tax by using the tax fields. The grand total of each tax entered appears in the tax field in the reservation header.</p>
        <p>There is a checkbox <span class="span_2">Print Plus Applicable Taxes</span> only visible if the Tax total for the reservation is zero. If this new setting is checked and if <span class="span_2">Amount Details</span> captured within the Reservation (per xx pricing is checked), then upon printing the Amount Details on the Proposal/Invoice/Itinerary (Plus Applicable Taxes) appear after the pricing. This setting can assist with hotel or car type reservations where the exact tax amount charged upon check-in is not known, yet you want to let the customer aware of the fact that there could be additional taxes.</p>

        </p>
        <p><span>Fare Savings Information:</span> For back office reporting purposes, you can capture fare savings information for each <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> reservation, including <span class="span_2">High Fare, Low Fare </span>and<span class="span_2"> Fare Code</span>. These fields are captured in the <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> fields upon invoicing for client reporting purposes.</p>
        <p><span>Markup/Discount Information:</span> For markups and discounts that you do not want broken out on the client invoice or vendor statement, you can capture a client <span class="span_2">Markup</span>, which adds to the reservation totals, or a <span class="span_2">Discount</span>, which subtracts from the reservation totals. If a Markup or Discount amount is entered then a new field is displayed within the Reservation totals called <span class="span_2">After Markup</span> or <span class="span_2">After Discount</span> depending on which is selected. If a markup or discount amount is captured, the <span class="span_2">Face Value </span>field is automatically calculated in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> upon invoicing. <span>Note:</span> If you do want the discount or markup broken out on the client invoice, then use the <span class="span_2">Itemize</span> area of the reservation pricing rather than the <span class="span_2">Markup/Discount</span> fields in this area.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Payment Due Date Tab contains the following entry fields:</p>
        <p><span>Deposit Due Date:</span> Enter the date the deposit is due. By clicking the down arrow, select a date by double-clicking the desired day from the calendar, or free-flow the date.</p>
        <p><span>Final Deposit Due Date:</span> Enter the date the final deposit is due. By clicking the down arrow, select a date by double-clicking the desired day from the calendar, or free-flow the date. <span>Note: </span>If you want to print a Final Payment report, this is the field that report picks up. </p>
        <p><span>Deposit Amount/Form of Payment/Check/CC #: </span>If a deposit is paid via Live Connect, these fields are populated as part of the Live Connect import, or they can be captured by hand. If these fields are completed via Live Connect or by manual input, upon invoicing the reservation for the first time, the invoice amount defaults to the <span class="span_2">Deposit Amount</span> and the <span class="span_2">Form of Payment</span> defaults to the <span class="span_2">Form of Payment</span> captured in this <span class="span_2">Payment Due Date</span> tab. </p>
        <p><span>Create a Reminder:</span> To create a reminder which appears on the user’s daily to-do list, click <span class="span_2">Create a Reminder</span> and fill in the appropriate details. The reminders are automatically created; one for <span class="span_2">Deposit Due Date</span> and one for <span class="span_2">Final Payment Due Date</span>. These reminders also appear in the Res Card’s <span class="span_2">Activities</span> tab, as well as in the client’s profile folder, <span class="span_2">Activities</span>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Enter unlimited free-flowing agent remarks for personal agent reference. These do not print anywhere.</p>
        <h4>Reservation More Fields Tab (Top Of Reservation)</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 12 An In-Depth Look at Res Cards/An In Depth Look at Res Cards_20.jpg" style="height: 72px;width: 575px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Res%20Cards.16.1.24.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>The More Fields tab and its entries provide your agency with customizable fields designed to capture data that is unique to your agency's or clients' needs. By including More Fields at the Reservation level, you have the ability to capture a More Field entry for just a specific Reservation within a Res Card without applying it to the entire Res Card. </p>
        <p>Also, since More Field entries can be linked to a TBO UDID, having Reservation level More Fields provide more flexibility around including specific UDID's only on certain Invoice Bookings. Upon invoicing, if a Reservation level More Field is linked to a UDID, then the UDID is captured only on that specific Reservation Booking in TBO. </p>
        <p>A Res Card level More Field, when linked to a UDID, continues to populate all TBO Invoice Booking UDID fields. Upon invoicing, if the same More Field has an entry at the Reservation level and Res Card level, then the Reservation level overrides the Res Card level and the TBO UDID captures the Reservation level More Field entry.</p>
        <p>These Res Card level print settings can be checked by default by going to <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Default Field Values for Res Cards</span> and clicking on the Res Card More Fields tab. By default each More Field category is set to not print, but in addition to changing the Global Defaults, these print defaults can also be changed per Res Card and Reservation. If a More Field is set to print, any Res Card level entries print at bottom of the Invoice totals above Branch, Client and Agent Remarks and any Reservation level entries print at the bottom of Reservation details and above Itin/Invoice Remarks and Vendor Remarks.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Res Card More Field Usage">&#160;</MadCap:keyword><span>NOTE</span><span> Res Card More Field Usage</span> <span>:</span><span>&#160; </span>When More Fields are created, the same More Fields can be used either at the Res Card Level or at the Reservation Level. When a More Field value is entered at the Res Card Level, that value carries over into each of the invoice bookings.&#160; A unique More Field value can be made for a specific reservation; however, by going into the More Field tab inside the reservation.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h4>Edit History Tab (Top of Reservation)</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 12 An In-Depth Look at Res Cards/An In Depth Look at Res Cards_21.jpg" style="height: 72px;width: 575px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Res%20Cards.16.1.25.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>This area provides you with a history of the changes users make to reservations, and a place to view that history if there is a question as to how something got added or modified. The Edit History log includes the <span class="span_2">User, Date/Time, Field Name, Old Entry, New Entry</span> and the ability to print the Edit History as a report. </p>
        <p><span>Fields the Edit History tracks at the Reservation Level:</span> Date Reserved, Booking Status, Vendor, Confirmation #, Travelers, Base, Tax, Commission, Duration, # of Pax, No of Cabins, Deposit Due Date, Final Payment Due Date, and Reservation Pay Information. </p>
        <h4>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Service Provider">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>&#160;Service Provider, General Tab (Bottom of Reservation)</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 12 An In-Depth Look at Res Cards/An In Depth Look at Res Cards_22.jpg" style="height: 65px;width: 603px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Res%20Cards.16.1.26.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>The <span>Service Provider </span>area of a reservation record is completely optional (when using the Live Connect option, these fields are populated). Information entered here appears on itineraries and invoices generated for this reservation and can be used for reporting purposes. One reservation record can have one or more service providers. For example, a Disney Cruise reservation record can include just one service provider, Disney Cruise Lines, or perhaps more than one, the Disney Magic and the Contemporary Resort. The amount of detail to capture is up to you.</p>
        <p>The <span>Service Provider </span>section of the screen has up to 7 tabs depending on the selected Travel Category: <span>General </span>(to enter service provider information); <span>Address</span> (this area is filled in automatically if the vendor profile has this information in it; otherwise enter free-flow information); <span>Itinerary</span> (appears where individual segments are entered), <span>Traveler Details</span> (where individual traveler details are entered)<span class="span_2">, </span><span>Itinerary/Invoice Remarks</span> (enter free-flowing itinerary/invoice remarks for the service provider); <span>Agent Remarks</span> (enter unlimited free-flowing agent remarks); and <span class="span_2">Allocated Pricing </span>(costs for each service provider can be itemized but does not print on any client reports). By default the dollar amounts fall in the first service provider allocated pricing area. If you would like a break-down of all service providers in the reservation, you must manually enter details into the allocated pricing area for each service provider. These allocated pricing fields are picked up in the Res Card <span class="span_2">Service Provider Activity Report</span>.</p>
        <p>Depending on the selected travel category, the service provider section, General Tab, contains the following entry fields:</p>
        <p><span>Travel Category:</span> Enter the travel category (setup in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> if you have this program, or in the Global Defaults) from the drop-down menu. Different data entry fields appear for each travel category. Examples are:</p>
        <p>For Air, a separate service provider record may be completed for each segment or leg in the itinerary - with numerous fields available such as <span class="span_2">Check-In times, Departure Terminals, Equipment, Meal Service, Duration, Mileage</span>, etc. For Hotel, entry fields include <span class="span_2">Property, Room Type, Check In and Out Dates, Room Description, and Smoking</span>. Car entry fields include <span class="span_2">Car Company, Start Date, End Date, Car Category, Pick-Up Time, Drop-Off Time, and Car Description</span>. Cruise entry fields include <span class="span_2">Ship, Start Date, End Date, Category, Deck, Cabin/Room, Dining, and Smoking</span>. </p>
        <p>Depending on the other selected categories, appropriate travel category entry fields appear.</p>
        <p><span>Service Provider Name: </span>If you have set up your Global Defaults to do so, by default when you put in the vendor at the top of the reservation, it drops into the service provider name field. Enter a few letters of the service provider to Query for its profile. For example, you may have entered Carnival Cruise Lines as the vendor, but want to show Ecstasy as the ship or Service Provider, the product that the vendor is selling. (You can also free-flow into this field, if this has been enabled.) </p>
        <p>If a reservation Service Provider record is linked to a Service Provider profile, then the <span class="span_2">Go To Profile</span> button next to the Service Provider (it’s the 2 heads with the red arrow icon to the right of the field) takes you to the Service Provider profile. If the Service Provider entry was completed via free flow entry (vs. clicking the down arrow and selecting from the list of existing Vendor/Service Provider profiles), clicking the <span class="span_2">Go To Profile</span> button will not navigate you anywhere.</p>

        <p>Car, insurance, miscellaneous, tour and transportation travel categories default the <span class="span_2">Print on Itin/Invoice</span> box to being unchecked, but can be added if you want addresses to print on the itinerary or the invoice. To change these default settings for new reservations go to <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Default Field Values for Res Cards</span>, click Reservation tab and either place a check or remove the check from the <span class="span_2">Print Address on Itin/Invoice</span> for the corresponding Travel Category. <span class="span_2">Flight Details </span>would appear on an air Service Provider entry.</p>

        <p>Click <span class="span_2">Itinerary</span> (if it appears after the travel category has been selected) to enter the details of the trip which are printed on the customer’s itinerary. Depending on the travel category selected under the General Tab, the appropriate data input screen appears. The example below is for air itinerary information. Click <span class="span_2">Insert</span>, <span class="span_2">Update,</span> or <span class="span_2">New</span>.</p>
        <p><span>Note:</span> If you have selected <span class="span_2">Cruise </span>as the Travel Type, there appears <span class="span_2">Print Options</span> including two formats: <span class="span_2">Do Not Sort/List Depart then Arrive</span> and <span class="span_2">Sort by Date/List Arrive then Depart</span>. <span class="span_2">Do Not Sort/List Depart then Arrive</span> prints the Cruise Itinerary as it has in the past versions of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. The <span class="span_2">Sort by Date/List Arrive then Depart</span> provides the format that conforms to the more traditional way cruise itineraries are printed.</p>
        <p>To change this default format for new reservations, go to <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Default Field Values for Res Cards</span>, click the Reservation tab and set the Print Cruise Itin Option accordingly. The default can be tailored on a reservation-by-reservation basis to whatever format is desired for that cruise itinerary by changing it on the drop-down menu. </p>

        <p>You do not need to add individual reminders for a trip if you have setup a Batch of Reminders in Global Defaults. Create multiple reminders all at one time by following these steps:</p>

        </p>
        <p>1) From the Res Card, click <span class="span_2">Batched Reminders</span> located at the top right corner of the Res Card, or in the activity tab click <span class="span_2">Batch Reminders </span>to get a listing of the batch reminders which were setup under Global Defaults. </p>
        <p>2) Select the batch to use for this Res Card by double-clicking the desired batch, or highlighting batch and clicking <span class="span_2">OK</span>. </p>
        <p>3) A listing of all of the default reminders included within the selected batch appears with the date of reminder defaulting based upon the merge field used. (If any of the Reminders in the listing do not have a current <span class="span_2">Date of Reminder</span>, then the merge field used when setting up was left blank within the current Res Card. In order for these reminders to be created you must double-click the specific reminder within the listing and enter the date by hand.) </p>
        <p>From this listing <span class="span_2">Add</span>, <span class="span_2">Modify</span> or <span class="span_2">Delete</span> any of the default Reminders. Check each of the reminders within the listing to make sure the defaults are all correct. To change any of the defaults, simply highlight the reminder, click <span class="span_2">Modify</span> and change the fields accordingly. Delete any reminders you do not want created for this particular Res Card, or simply uncheck its box.</p>
        <p>4) When all reminders in the listing meet your needs, click <span class="span_2">Create Reminders</span> and they are created at one time, and saved within the activities tab. </p>

        <p>a) For Air, Hotel, Cruise, Tour, Rail and Transportation reservations, make sure in each of the Vendor Profiles used for these types of reservations have a <span class="span_7">Province </span><span class="span_7">filled in</span>, and in the <span class="span_7">Country </span><span class="span_7">field</span>, either leave blank, type Canada or CA.</p>

        </p>
        <p>c) Service Fees look to the <span class="span_7">client profile’s </span><span class="span_7">Province</span><span class="span_7"> field</span> to determine the default GST/HST rate to apply.</p>
        <p>d) Insurance and International defaults as <span class="span_7">zero rated</span>.</p>
        <p>e) Transborder Reservations <span class="span_7">default to 5% for all Travel Categories</span>.</p>
        <p>Please note that these default rates are simply defaults and can be updated on a reservation-by reservation basis. If the user overrides a reservation percentage in either the client GST/HST field or the Commission GST/HST field, <span class="span_7">the other field will be updated to reflect the same percentage</span>.</p>
        <p>For example, if client GST/HST is defaulted to 5% and user changes it to 13%, then the Commission HST changes to 13% also, and vice versa. If the user wants to override one percentage, but not the other, then a dollar amount must be entered in place of a percentage.</p>
        <p>Since a large portion of the Commission GST/HST calculations is based on the profile Province where the client or vendor resides, <span>it is important to ensure your client and vendor profiles contain a Province and non</span><span class="span_8">-</span><span>Canadian profiles contain a Country code. </span>The province should use 2 letter codes as follows: BC, AB, etc.</p>
        <p><span>3) </span>The lookup logic on the profile will first look for Canadian profiles by checking the country field. If the <span>Country</span> field contains <span class="span_2">CANADA, CA or is blank</span>, it will look in the <span>Province</span> field to determine if there’s a match to one of the Provinces in the rate table and if so, use the applicable rate to calculate the default GST/HST for the Reservation.</p>
        <p><span>4) </span>Querying profiles and sorting by Country and Province will help you quickly locate profiles with empty fields and the Global Modify feature (used with caution) can help to easily populate those fields. </p>
        <p>Be sure to backup your database before using the Global Modify feature. </p>
        <p><span>5) </span>For cars, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses the <span class="span_7">Pickup City in the Service Provider</span> record and then uses the city code table to locate the province and lookup the province rate. </p>
        <p>Therefore, <span>it is also important that your city code table (Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|City Codes) has province codes for each applicable city and they match the province codes included in the Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Tax and Commission Defaults.</span></p>
        <p><span>6) </span>Both Client GST/HST and Commission GST/HST amounts can be viewed at the same time regardless of which Reservation tab is currently active. That means agents do not need to click on the More Taxes tab to view the effects on the Commission GST/HST when making changes to the Client GST/HST or vice versa.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><span>Note:</span> If using Live Connect and PNR Import features so that if GST/HST applies, and no Commission GST/HST is included in the file, the same logic described above is used to default the Commission GST/HST rate.</p>

        <p>When handling multiple currencies, reservations can be tracked in the agency's currency or reservations can be tracked in the foreign (vendor) currency. The setting <span class="span_2">By Default Track Res Card Balances In</span>" under <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Currency Setup </span>can be setup as the default. This is simply a default and can be overridden per Res Card. </p>
        <p>A Multi Currency tab added to the Res Card also contains this <span class="span_2">Track Res Card Balances In</span> setting in order to update Res Card balances on a one-by-one basis. (<span>Note: </span>All multi currency Res Card balances entered prior to version 3.6 will remain in the Agency Currency unless modified individually.) New reservations with multiple currencies are also tracked in Agency Currency until the setting is changed in Global Defaults or the setting is changed per Res Card under the Multi Currency tab. </p>

        <p>Although res card balance tracking can be changed from Agency Currency to Foreign Currency and vice versa, change will only occur if Res Card is not invoiced. If the Res Card is already invoiced, this setting under the Multi Currency tab is disabled. If changing from Agency Currency to Foreign Currency, the system checks to see if the record contains Markup/Discounts and if so prompts, <span class="span_2">Markup/Discounts exist and are not supported when balances are tracked in the Foreign Currency. Continuing will clear any Markup/Discounts entered. Continue? Yes/No</span>." </p>
        <p>When tracking Res Card balances in Foreign Currency, itemization can now be captured. Itemization is captured in the reservation's currency. If itemization is captured and user changes the selected currency, user is prompted <span class="span_2">Changing the Reservation Currency will clear all Itemization details. Do you want to continue? Yes/No.</span> Since itemization cannot be captured when Res Card balances are tracked in Agency Currency, if changing Res Card from Foreign Currency to Agency Currency the system checks to see if Itemization exists and if so prompts <span class="span_2">Itemization exists. Currency cannot be converted at the itemization level. Continuing will clear all itemization details. Continue? Yes/No</span></p>
        <p><span class="span_6">If agency chooses to continue to track reservation totals in the agency's currency</span>, an invoice setting gives the options of showing traveler pricing for each reservation in Agency, Vendor and/or Client currency on an invoice. Select <span>Utilities|Branch</span> and then click <span class="span_2">Format Settings</span> under Invoice Settings (this can be done remember at the time of invoicing, by clicking on <span class="span_2">Invoice Format)</span>. A Multi-Currency section is available for selection with the options of <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency, Show Vendor Currency and Show Client Currency</span>.

        <p><span>Example:</span> An agency located in Canada booked a cruise with a US vendor. In the Multiple Currency screen the Vendor currency was entered as $1500 US dollars. The Agency Currency was entered as $1400 Canadian dollars. If the <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency</span> option was checked, only the Canadian dollars appear under pricing when the invoice is generated. If both <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency</span> and <span class="span_2">Show Vendor Currency</span> options were checked, pricing appears in both Canadian dollars and US dollars. If the client paid for the reservation in a different currency (i.e. Euros) and that amount was entered as the Client Currency on the Multiple Currency screen and all three options where checked, pricing would appear in all three currencies.</p>
        <p><span class="span_7">If agency chooses to track reservation totals in the foreign currency,</span> when tracking balances in Foreign currency there is no longer a Multi Currency screen. Each reservation is entered in the currency it was booked in by clicking the Currency drop-down and selecting the correct currency code. Once the currency code is chosen the currency rate is displayed. Currency rates are based on the Currency Setup in Global Defaults but can be changed at the time of booking if needed. However, if ARC/BSP is checked, the currency must remain in the agency's currency and the Currency field is disabled. </p>

        </p>
        <p>For each reservation, the Reservation Totals summary on the right side of the screen shows the currency code for all foreign currency bookings. The Res Card totals in the Res Card Header will summarize all balances with one line per currency. The first two currencies are displayed; however, if more lines exist, click the button next to the Res Card header to view all. </p>
        <p>Reservation totals at the bottom of the Res Card show the balance of the Selected Reservation in the currency it was booked along with the Currency Code. The balances displayed for All Confirmed Reservations summarize all reservations booked in the agency's currency. Click the button next to the Reservation totals at the bottom of the Res Card to view all Reservation totals. </p>

All reservations are then totaled per currency and appear at the bottom of the invoice, one box of totals per currency. </p>
        <p>Client payments are printed on the invoice in the reservation's currency. If agency also uses <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> software, client credit card payments are saved in TBO in the agency's currency. Client payments entered as CC Merchant, Debit Card, Check and Cash payments are not saved in TBO and need to be handled in the back office by the bookkeeper.</p>

        <p><span>Note:</span> This does not apply to ARC type reservations, neither a partial payment or multiple Forms of Payment will be accepted for ARC reservations. </p>
        <p>To capture more than one payment, or a partial payment, for a single Reservation, click the <span class="span_2">Booking Payment </span>button: </p>
        <p>The Booking Payment screen has the ability to capture multiple payments by using the <span class="span_2">Insert, Update </span>and<span class="span_2"> New</span> buttons. This screen also displays the reservation's<span class="span_2"> Current Invoice </span>amount as well as the total payments entered so far. Payments cannot total more than your <span class="span_2">Current Invoice</span> amount. If your payments total less than your<span class="span_2"> Current Invoice</span> amount, then you are prompted with the following options upon trying to save the Booking Payment:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 12 An In-Depth Look at Res Cards/An In Depth Look at Res Cards_64.jpg" style="height: 245px;width: 437px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Res%20Cards2.17.1.29.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>• <span>Update Invoice Amount:</span> Changes the Current Invoice amount to match the total Payments entered.</p>
        <p>• <span>Leave Balance Open:</span> Leaves the Current Invoice amount and total payments as is and creates an open booking for the balance.</p>
        <p>• <span>Return to Payment:</span> Takes the user back to the Booking Payments screen to update the payments accordingly.</p>
        <p>When a single payment (or no payment) is applied to a single reservation, upon generating an invoice, the system creates one invoice booking record for the one reservation. When either multiple FOP's (Forms of Payment) or partial payments are entered for a single reservation, the system then creates a separate Invoice Booking for each FOP. Each Invoice Booking created is identical except for the booking amount, which matches the payment amount.</p>
        <p><span>Important Note regarding single payments for multiple bookings saving as separate payment records:</span> <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> saves a separate payment record for each booking, even if there is a single Form of Payment. In other words, if a cruise deposit of $200.00 and an insurance reservation of $300.00 is invoiced at the same time with one check, #255 for $500.00, upon generating the invoice, two invoice bookings are created and two payment received records are created, one for $200.00, and one for $300.00.</p>
        <p><span>Important Note regarding handling Commission and Tax amounts when multiple or partial FOP's results in split bookings:</span> <span class="span_2">If multiple payments add up to the amount being invoiced, handle commission with the following hierarchy:</span></p>
        <p>- Put invoiced commission total on largest Cash, Check, EFT or CC Merchant booking</p>
        <p>- If no Cash, Check, EFT or CC Merchant FOP’s, then put invoiced commission total on largest CC booking</p>
        <p class="p_6">If multiple payments add up to the amount being invoiced, handle tax with the following hierarchy:</p>
        <p>- Put full tax on the largest booking regardless of FOP</p>
        <p>- If it’s a partial payment (payment amounts do not add up to invoiced amount), put all tax and commission on the open booking</p>
        <p>- Don’t worry about invoice bookings resulting in negative Base Fares</p>
        <p>- Don’t worry about invoice bookings resulting in negative net amounts (commission being greater than base or total fare). A new "Voucher" form of payment is now available when generating an invoice.</p>
        <p><span>Voucher Form of Payment:</span> Previously, as agents received money from customers for payment against future trips, the agent created a receipt in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Later, once a trip was booked and the time came to apply the receipt against an invoice, the agent could generate the invoice but someone in Back Office had to apply the receipt against it. Now if given permission, an agent can apply a voucher in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> when invoicing.</p>
        <p>A setting <span class="span_2">Disable Voucher Form of Payment</span> was added to the <span>Advanced Security Level|Other Restrictions</span> tab of user settings in order to control who is allowed to perform this function. When unchecked, an agent is able to see Total Voucher Balance on both the profile and invoicing screen and has the ability to apply the balance against invoices. This setting is unchecked by default and therefore you must check the box to disable the feature for any user you do not want to perform this function.</p>
        <p>Vouchers are applied to invoices at the booking level. Displayed next to the Trip Balance Due Date is the Voucher Balance. This field only appears if the customer has a voucher balance. </p>

When highlighting a voucher number you will see the voucher's Issue Date, Branch, Group, Voucher Balance and any Payment Remarks to help in deciding which voucher to use.

        </p>
        <p>All booking payments must add up to the same amount invoiced for that booking. If the amount of the voucher selected is greater than the amount invoiced, the voucher balance is updated to reflect the remaining balance for future use. Voucher payments appear on invoice as <span class="span_2">Paid by Prior Receipt</span>. </p>
        <p><span>Notes:</span> **Res cards with foreign currency reservations are NOT allowed to use this new form of payment.</p>
        <p>**If your agency syncs databases, vouchers can only be applied to an invoice from the Primary.</p>
        <p>**If your agency is a <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> user, when a voucher is applied to an invoice, a zero payment is recorded in TBO that shows the voucher was applied to the invoice.

        <p><span>Submit to:</span> From the drop-down menu, choose appropriate <span class="span_2">Submit To</span>. <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> users want to choose the one that corresponds with <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> Submits To as setup by bookkeeper. If the Submit To field is set to <span class="span_2">CommTrack, </span>a little checkbox appears just above the <span class="span_2">Not Yet Invoiced</span> column of the invoice screen. This is your global default setting showing if Commission Track items paid by credit card print on the invoices for that travel category. So if you normally default to print, but for this one invoice you don’t want payments to print, you can remove the check. If your default is not to print, but for this one invoice you want payments to print, add the check. </p>
        <p><span>Notes for TBO Users: </span>When invoicing Supplier or Commission type transactions paid by <span class="span_2">Cash, Check or CC Merchant,</span> a field is added to the invoicing screen called <span class="span_2">Due Vendor</span>. This <span class="span_2">Due Vendor</span> field is designed to capture the date the payment is due to the vendor being invoiced. This date defaults to either the <span class="span_2">Deposit Due Date</span> or <span class="span_2">Final Payment Due Date</span> captured in the <span class="span_2">Payment Due Date</span> tab of the reservation depending on whether the reservation has been invoiced yet or not. This default can be overwritten at the time of invoicing and the date captured is saved in the <span class="span_2">Date Payable</span> field in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>. </p>
        <p>There is also a <span class="span_2">Due From Vendor</span> date field which appears for Comm Track type bookings. This field defaults blank, but if completed, lands within the <span class="span_2">Date Payable</span> field within the <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> view of the invoice booking and represents the date the commission should be paid by the Vendor.</p>
        <p><span>Agent/Amount/%Rate:</span> The agent is pulled in from the Res Card header, but can be changed from the drop-down menu. Adjust <span class="span_2">Amount</span> or <span class="span_2">%Rate</span> if necessary (this is being pulled from the agent profile). </p>
        <p><span>More Agents:</span> By clicking this area, add more agents to this invoice, indicating <span class="span_2">Inside </span>or <span class="span_2">Outside, Amount</span>, and<span class="span_2"> % Rate</span>. By clicking <span class="span_2">Default</span>, the default agent rate from the profile is automatically placed in the data entry screen. Add a remark if desired. If the agent reconciliation routine is run in TBO, the <span class="span_2">Date Paid</span> field is filled in at the completion of the routine. </p>
        <p>To disallow agents to view other agents’ commission default, setup the user login permissions to include an option called <span class="span_2">Disable Ability to View Agent Commission when Invoicing.</span> If this option is checked, then that user is not be able to see the default Agent Commission % or Amount when working with the agent lists at the time of invoicing. The user is able to see what default agents are assigned to the invoice and have the ability to attach additional agents to the invoice if desired, but neither the % nor amount is displayed.

            <li class="ListParagraph_2">Within <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> you can set default agent commission rates at both the Travel Type level and the General level. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> looks first for a default rate at the Travel Type level and if no default rate exists, then looks for a default rate at the general level.

            <li class="ListParagraph_2">The primary agent for the Res Card is defaulted at the time of invoicing as the agent for the invoice. If the agency uses <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>, and the agent profile in TBO has a default Inside Rate, that Inside Rate becomes the default agent rate for that invoice. If there is no default Inside Rate, then the default Outside Rate becomes the default agent rate for that invoice. If there is no default Inside or Outside Rate within the agent profile in TBO, then there is no default agent rate for that invoice.</li>

        </p>
        <p>These are just suggestions which can be used as a foundation for your own invoicing process. These steps will create a BASIC Res Card and invoice:</p>
        <p>1) For every client trip, find the client profile. If no profile exists, create a new one.</p>
        <p>2) In the client profile, make sure the profile contains the following info: Accurate address, phone and e-mail. </p>
        <p>3) Click the <span class="span_2">Traveler</span> tab and review traveler list. Add any missing travelers by entering the First/Middle Name/Last Name and birthdate to start. </p>
        <p>4) Click the <span class="span_2">Cards</span> tab and review credit card (including valid expiration date) or other card information as needed for this trip. Edit or Add Card. </p>
        <p>5) Click the <span class="span_2">Res Card </span>tab and check for an existing Res Card. If a Res Card does not exist, click Res Card icon on toolbar at top of profile and create a new Res Card. All reservations and invoices are kept inside the Res Card. One Res Card per trip.</p>
        <p>6) In new Res Card, choose appropriate Reservation Cycle (always use drop-downs if available), enter a meaningful Trip Name (used to find Res Card in profile or Res Card Manager), and select applicable Traveler Names. (If using the <span class="span_2">PNR Import </span>of <span class="span_2">Live Connect Import </span>feature, no travelers need to be added here. They will come in from the imports. But do add Region and Destination for consortia and marketing purposes. Enter applicable Agent Remarks. Click <span class="span_2">Apply</span>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>7) From Reservation tab, add reservation to enter reservation details. For vendor, type in a few letters of vendor's name, tab, and choose from drop-down. (If there is not profile in system, create one.) Make sure the Travel Category is correct for this vendor.</p>
        <p>8) Enter confirmation #, total pricing for this reservation, and Payment Due dates for Deposit and Final Payment.</p>
        <p>9) In the Service Provider area add Trip Start Date/End Date along with any additional details. Click OK to save. (If this vendor is arranging more than one Service Provider for this reservation; i.e., cruise, insurance, tour, etc., the details may be individually added by inserting each in the Service Provider area.) </p>
        <p>10) From main screen, continue entering reservations for each new vendor. </p>
        <p>11) Apply to save all Res Card changes. Click the Generate Invoice icon on toolbar at top of screen.</p>
        <p>12) Click Remarks and select desired remarks (created in Utilities|Branch) which prints at the bottom of the invoice. Enter a Trip Balance Due Date if applicable. Select Form of Payment </p>
        <p>13) In the <span class="span_2">This Invoice</span> area, enter the actual dollar amount paid at this time and the correct Travel Type and Submit To. On a credit card sale, if the Submit to is CommTrack and the booking is actually being paid (as opposed to a hotel guarantee), then make sure the Showed as Paid box is checked. Repeat process for each reservation being invoiced at this time. <span class="span_2">Preview</span>. </p>
        <p>14) If the amounts or other information doesn't look correct in preview, return to reservation and correct. Otherwise click <span class="span_2">Generate Invoice</span> to issue the invoice. At this time, the invoice may be printed or e-mailed from this screen. Attach saves a true copy for future access. The invoice is now permanently available in the Invoices tab of the Res Card for reprint/e-mail at any time or in the Attachment tab of the Res Card or profile. </p>

            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Change the booking amount to the amount of the penalty. Enter $0.00 as the commission unless the agency gets to keep any of its commission. If so, enter the amount the agency keeps.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Delete the individual Service Providers (not applicable for this booking).</li>

        <p><span>Step 3:</span> Open the original reservation and change status to 'Cancelled'. Leave the rest of the information as originally entered. Review amounts for accuracy. Change the Res Card status to Cancelled. </p>
        <p><span>Step 4: </span>Generate the Refund Invoice and check off <span class="span_2">Include Refunds</span>. In the Form of Payment section, choose the type of payment that will be refunded (cash, check, credit card). Select the original booking, and at the payment amount, choose 'Refund', and enter the amount originally invoiced. Select the cancellation fee booking, and at the payment amount, choose <span class="span_2">Sale</span> and invoice the full amount.</p>

        <p>Preview the invoice to ensure the net refund is correct, then generate the invoice. The Res Card shows a zero dollar balance.</p>
        <p><span>Reminder: </span>If an invoice has more refunds than sales, a Refund Invoice is issued. If the invoice has more sales than refunds, then a Sales Invoice is issued. All invoices issued in ClientBase are available in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>.</p>

        <p>To print out a Trip Proposal for a client, click the<span class="span_2"> Proposal </span>icon on the Res Card toolbar<span class="span_2">. </span></p>
        <p><span>Format: </span>Select <span class="span_2">Client Quote </span>or<span class="span_2"> Client Quote Invoice Style. </span>The <span class="span_2">Client Quote Invoice Style</span> format uses the same reporting tool and format settings as the Generate Invoice feature, but simply prints a client quote and does not generate an invoice or update trip balances in any way. This is the perfect way to provide a format-friendly printout of reservations you have made which does not have to coincide with receiving payment from your client. </p>
        <p><span>Include Res Itin/Inv Remarks:</span> Click to include Itin/Inv remarks on reservations.</p>
        <p><span>Trip Proposal Format:</span> If you are using the format <span class="span_2">Client Quote,</span> by clicking here you can pick from tables of Branch, Agent, Vendor, or Client remarks. Check off the remark/s to use with this particular trip proposal, and then <span class="span_2">OK</span>.</p>
        <p>Note: Branch and Trip Proposal Remarks have been setup by the database administrator, but Agent, Vendor, and Client Remarks can be setup in any Agent, Vendor, and Client Profile by clicking on the <span class="span_2">Res Card Remark </span>tab. Vendor remarks appear under the Vendor level reservation data after vendor level Itin/Invoice remarks. At the end of the invoice, remarks appear in this order: <span class="span_2">Branch Remarks, Insurance Waiver, Client, </span>and <span class="span_2">Agent Remarks.</span></p>
        <p>If you are using the <span class="span_2">Client Quote Invoice Style </span>format, in addition to being able to select remarks, you also have the ability to override certain Trip Proposal defaults: <span class="span_2">Include Service Provider Graphics, Hide Reservation Vendor Name, Hide Reservation Totals (Include Only Invoice Totals), Print, Service Fee as Invoice Total Line Item, Service Fee Label, and Print Reservation in Condensed Format</span> (if checked, upon invoicing a reservation for that Travel Category, a summary of basic Reservation information is included, rather than a detailed listing of all Reservation and Service Provider level information.)</p>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Client Quote</span> format upon launching ends up in a word processing for editing. From here you can <span class="span_2">Print, </span>send to <span class="span_2">Word</span> for additional editing, <span class="span_2">E-mail</span> to the client in text format only, or <span class="span_2">Attach</span> as a pdf attachment to the Res Card. Clicking <span class="span_2">Attach</span> automatically generates a .pdf version of the document you are viewing and attach it as a file to the Res Card you are working in. This gives you the ability to create a permanent record of an Trip Proposal as it appeared at the time of generating it, including any customization, formatting etc. Go to the Attachments tab of the Res Card to access or print any of these attached files.</p>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Client Quote Invoice Style</span> like a generated invoice is "hard coded", but can be edited by clicking on the <span class="span_2">Word </span>icon. When e-mailed the quote is in text format with a pdf in the e-mail <span class="span_2">Attachment Tab</span>. If multiple e-mail addresses exist for the profile, the system prompts with a listing of all e-mail addresses and allows you to select more than one e-mail, providing you with the ability to send these trip documents to multiple e-mail addresses at one time. The profile's primary e-mail address is selected by default. Specific e-mail addresses from the listing can be checked individually, or Select All can be checked to send to all e-mail addresses within the profile. </p>
        <p>Make sure to create a mailer, so a record of the mailing is present in the Res Card and Client Profile. </p>
