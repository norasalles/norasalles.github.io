        <p class="p_2">This chapter provides a detailed overview of using the PNR Import feature in ClientBase. PNR Import is currently available for Amadeus, Apollo/Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan.</p>
        <p>Reservations stored within an Amadeus, Apollo/Galileo, Sabre, or Worldspan PNR can be imported into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, and new reservation records can be created within the reservation tab of the Res Card. Once the new reservations reside in the Res Card, print out client quotes, itineraries, or add additional reservations using Live Connect and generate invoices.<br /><br /></p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="PNR Import for Amadeus">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Set Up PNR Import for Amadeus</h2>
        <p>The PNR Import for Amadeus takes air, car, hotel and rail segments included in an Amadeus PNR and imports them into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card reservation records. For tour and cruise bookings, users can use Live Connect to bring these into the program.</p>
        <p>Amadeus has 3 platforms - APS (which stands for Amadeus Pro Software), Vista, and ProWeb. The Amadeus tool we use for Merge to PNR and PNR Import is called Amadeus +Script and is available with both APS and Vista platforms. (If the agency’s APS or Vista platform did not come with this +Script tool activated, then contact the Amadeus support desk to turn it on. Amadeus has agreed to waive an fees associated with +Scripts for all <span class="span_2">Trams</span> customers, so there is no cost, just a phone call to the support desk.) <span class="span_2">Since +Scripts is unavailable with ProWeb, PNR Import function (as well as Merge to PNR via API) DOES NOT work with it.<br /></span></p>
        <h3>Steps to Import an Amadeus PNR</h3>
        <p>To import a PNR from Amadeus take the following steps:</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 1:</b> </span>Be sure you are currently logged into both Amadeus and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2: </span>Create a new Res Card or open an existing Res Card within the appropriate client profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 3:</b> </span>From the reservation tab at the bottom of the main Res Card screen, click <span class="span_2">PNR Import</span>.</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 4:</b> </span>Select Amadeus from the drop-down list in the CRS field.<br /></p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><span><b>Step 5:</b> </span>Enter the desired record locator or leave the record locator field blank to import the current, active PNR and click <span class="span_2">Import PNR. </span></p>
        <p>Multiple reservations may be included in one PNR, therefore multiple reservations may be imported as a result of the PNR import. All segments of an air itinerary are imported into one reservation, but additional car and hotel reservations are imported into separate reservation records.</p>
        <p>Each reservation imported into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> must link to an existing vendor profile within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database. To locate the appropriate vendor profile and automatically link to it, the system uses the Interface ID within the CRS and matches to an Interface ID within vendor profiles. If it finds a vendor profile with the same Interface ID, it imports the reservation automatically. If it does not find the Interface ID, a prompt appears indicating the Interface ID could be found. Click <span class="span_2">Query for Vendor by Name</span> and manually attach the reservation to the proper vendor profile if found by using the Query screen. If the vendor is not in the database, use <span class="span_2">Create New Vendor</span>, and add the vendor profile accordingly. Avoid accidentally creating duplicate vendor profiles by making sure Interface ID's are captured properly within the vendor profiles.</p>
        <p><span><i>Special Note</i>: </span>When a PNR is imported from a GDS, the <span class="span_2">Invoiced Outside</span> <span class="span_2">of CB+</span> is checked by default and the reservation amount is not included in the un-invoiced balance. This keeps the reservation from being invoiced twice.</p>
        <p>The Amadeus PNR import updates existing reservations. If the same PNR is imported multiple times, the systems now looks at the rec locator, vendor and confirmation number, and if all match, then it updates the existing reservation rather than appending it as another new reservation.<br /> <br /></p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="PNR Import for Apollo/Galileo">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Set Up PNR Import for Apollo/Galileo</h2>
        <p>This feature takes air, car, hotel, and rail segments included in an Apollo/Galileo PNR and imports them into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card reservation records. For tour and cruise bookings, users can use Live Connect to bring these into the program.</p>
        <p>This feature requires FocalPoint, FocalPoint Net, Desktop AND must also have ViewPoint 3.0 or higher on each set using the PNR Import feature. Although ViewPoint does not need to be used to create or retrieve the PNR, it needs to be running in the background, as it is a View Point tool that we are utilizing that turns the PNR segments into a file that <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> can then parse and import into reservation records.<br /> </p>
        <h3>Steps to Import an Apollo/Galileo PNR</h3>
        <p>To import a PNR from Apollo/Galileo take the following steps:</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 1</b>:</span> Be sure to have Viewpoint and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> running on your set. (Again, you don't need to use Viewpoint to create or retrieve the PNR, use Focal Point to do the PNR work, but you do need Viewpoint running).</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 2:</b> </span>Create a new Res Card or open an existing Res Card within the appropriate client profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3:</span> From the reservation tab at the bottom of the main Res Card screen click <span class="span_2">PNR Import</span>.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4:</span> Select Apollo/Galileo from the drop-down list in the CRS field.<br /></p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An In-Depth Look PNR Import/An In Depth Look at PNR Import_1.jpg" style="height: 353px;width: 344px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-Depth%20Look%20at%20PNR%20Import.33.1.2.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Import PNR</span>. This imports the current, active PNR in Viewpoint into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. (If you are using Focal Point, whatever PNR is active in Focal Point is also automatically be active in Viewpoint.) </p>
        <p>Multiple reservations may be included in one PNR, therefore multiple reservations may be imported as a result of the PNR import. All segments of an air itinerary are imported into one reservation, but additional car and hotel reservations are imported into separate reservation records.</p>
        <p>Each reservation imported into <span class="span_2" style="font-style: italic;">ClientBase</span> must link to an existing vendor profile within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database. To locate the appropriate vendor profile and automatically link to it, the system uses the Interface ID within the CRS and matches to an Interface ID within vendor profiles. If it finds a vendor profile with the same Interface ID, it imports the reservation automatically. If it does not find the Interface ID, a prompt appears indicating the Interface ID could be found. Click <span class="span_2">Query for Vendor by Name</span> and manually attach the reservation to the proper vendor profile if found by using the Query screen. If the vendor is not in the database, use <span class="span_2">Create New Vendor</span>, and add the vendor profile accordingly. Avoid accidentally creating duplicate vendor profiles by making sure Interface ID's are captured properly within the vendor profiles.</p>
        <p><span><i>Special Note</i>: </span>When a PNR is imported from a GDS, the <span class="span_2">Invoiced Outside</span> <span class="span_2">of CB+</span> is checked by default and the reservation amount is not included in the un-invoiced balance. This keeps the reservation from being invoiced twice.</p>
        <p>The Apollo/Galileo PNR import updates existing reservations. If the same PNR is imported multiple times, the systems now looks at the rec locator, vendor and confirmation number, and if all match, then it updates the existing reservation rather than appending it as another new reservation. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Trams Back OfficeUsers and the Apollo PNR Import</h3>
        <p>When importing a PNR from Apollo, if you want to invoice in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> rather than invoice in Apollo, drive the invoice and ticket using the HB:DTD command. This generates a ticket without creating a MIR (interface record). After importing the PNR into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, generating the invoice from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> sends the air information (and any other items on the invoice) to <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> automatically. Uncheck the <span class="span_2">Invoiced Outside of CB+</span> checkbox and invoice in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Using this procedure eliminates duplicate invoices in <i>Trams Back Office</i>.</p>

        <h3>Steps to Import a Sabre PNR</h3>
        <p>To import a PNR from Sabre take the following steps:</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 1:</b> </span>Be sure you are currently logged into both Sabre and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4: </span>Select Sabre from the drop-down list in the CRS field.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An In-Depth Look PNR Import/An In Depth Look at PNR Import_3.jpg" style="height: 353px; width: 344px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-Depth%20Look%20at%20PNR%20Import.33.1.4.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5: </span>Enter the desired record locator or leave the record locator field blank to import the current, active PNR, and click <span class="span_2">Import PNR</span>.</p>
        <p>Multiple reservations may be included in one PNR, therefore multiple reservations may be imported as a result of the PNR import. All segments of an air itinerary are imported into one reservation, but additional car and hotel reservations are imported into separate reservation records.</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 6:</b> </span>Each reservation imported into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> must link to an existing vendor profile within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database.

This keeps the reservation from being invoiced twice.</p>
        <p>The Sabre PNR import brings in cruise and tour segments in addition to air, rail, car and hotel segments. Keep in mind that the PNR import only parses and imports the data contained in cruise and tour segments, not the accounting lines. If the cruise or tour segment is formatted to include pricing information then the price is imported, if pricing is formatted as a remark, then the price is imported to remarks and the pricing fields in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> reservation must be manually entered.</p>
        <p>The Sabre PNR import updates existing reservations. If the same PNR is imported multiple times, the systems now looks at the rec locator, vendor and confirmation number, and if all match, then it updates the existing reservation rather than appending it as another new reservation. </p>

        <h3>Trams Back Office Users and the Sabre PNR Import</h3>
        <p><span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> customers need to make decisions on how they are going to handle what's being invoiced in Sabre and conversely in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
        <p><span>Problem:</span> You create a PNR and then import it into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> - for example a ticket and service fee. Next you create an invoice with those items which automatically land in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> with a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> generated invoice number. Now you need to drive the ticket and service fee in Sabre in order to generate the ticket and MCO for the service fee. When you interface to <span class="span_2">Trams</span>, you now have 2 invoices in <span class="span_2">Trams</span> with different invoice numbers (one generated by <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, the other by Sabre). There is no option with Sabre to drive just a ticket without generating an invoice number and interface record. </p>
        <p><span>Solutions:</span> </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Option 1</span> - Drive the invoice for air and services fees from Sabre. Drive any other bookings from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Example Bookings - Air, Cruise or Tour, Service Fee</span> </p>
        <p>1. Once the data has been imported to the Res Card, uncheck the box, <span class="span_2">Include Summary of All Reservations</span>, so that only the invoiced items show on the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> invoice. If there is a cruise or tour on the Res Card in conjunction with air and service fee, just invoice the cruise or tour from the Res Card. </p>
        <p>2. Drive the ticket and MCO for the service fee from Sabre. </p>
        <p><span>Results:</span> You have 2 invoices for the customer and 2 invoices in TBO (one from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and one from Sabre). There is an un-invoiced amount on the Res Card for the air and service fee.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Option 2</span> - Create a separate POS queue in Sabre. Sabre may charge the agency to set this up as it is considered an additional "device." </p>
        <p>1. The agency imports the PNR to the Res Card.</p>
        <p>2. The agency drives the invoice in Sabre (to generate the ticket and MCO) with the command to send this interface record to an alternate POS queue. </p>
        <p>POS Queue #1 - This queue transmits interface records to <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> that are NOT imported into the Res Card. </p>
        <p>POS Queue #2 - This queue holds interface records that were imported into the Res Card - hence they will never DX transmit this queue. Sabre needs to clean the records out of this queue periodically. </p>
        <p><span>Results:</span> The agency would have one invoice with all bookings in the Res Card on it to give to the customer and one invoice in <cite>Trams Back Office</cite>. </p>
        <p><span>Special Note:</span> When a PNR is imported from a GDS, the "Invoiced Outside of CB+" is checked by default and the reservation amount is not included in the Un-invoiced Balance. This keeps the reservation from being invoiced twice. If you are creating another reservation in <cite>ClientBase</cite>, make sure the <span class="span_2">Invoiced Outside of CB+</span> area remains unchecked. </p>

        <p>This feature takes air, car, hotel, cruise, tour automated (Amtrak) rail and agency service fee (TVL) segments included in a Worldspan PNR (Worldspan Go! Res Dedicated or Internet 4.0 or above) and imports them into ClientBase Res Card reservation records. Contact your Worldspan Account Manager to enable a DIR Device, assign you a unique agent Pool Name, and provide you with a unique agency Connection ID.

        </p>
        <p><span><b>Step 3:</b> </span><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> needs to pass an Agent Sine, and your Agency Pool Name to Worldspan when PNR Import is performed. To set this so it defaults automatically, you can enter each Agent Sine and Agency Pool Name into each User Login record. To do this, have each User log into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and go to <span>Utilities|My Login|PNR Import</span>. Click <span class="span_2">Add</span> and set the CRS to Worldspan, entering agent's login Sine into <span class="span_2">Agent Sine</span>, and Agency Pool Name into the field, <span class="span_2">Agency Pool Name</span>. Each time this User performs a PNR Import the Agent Sine and Agency Pool Name default automatically. The SYSDBA can also enter this information into each User Login record by logging into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> as the SYSDBA and going to <span>Utilities|User Logins|User List </span>and retrieving each Login record and updating accordingly.</p>
        <p>The pool name will start with the same 6 numbers as the connection ID, followed by an under score, the agency’s pseudo city code, another underscore and 2 more numbers (i.e 123456_AB1_01). Any letters in the pseudo city code must be capitalized. </p>

        <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Special Note:</span> Worldspan requires agents to have a password to log into the reservations screen. </p>
        <p class="p_4">Example Reservations Login – BSI$1234RE/GS/PASSWORD.&#160; </p>
        <p>That same password must be included in the Clientbase PNR Import set up for the PNR Import feature to work. </p>
        <p>The password must be 8-12 characters with at least one numeric character and must be changed every 90 days, in Worldspan.&#160; </p>

        <h3>Steps to Import a Worldspan PNR</h3>
        <p>To import a PNR from Worldspan take the following steps:</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 1:</b> </span>You do not have to be currently logged into Worldspan, as this process will automatically open it for you.</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 2:</b> </span>Create a new Res Card or open an existing Res Card within the appropriate client profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 3:</b> </span>From the Reservation tab at the bottom of the main Res Card screen, click <span class="span_2">PNR Import</span> and Worldspan from the drop-down list. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 14 An In-Depth Look PNR Import/An In Depth Look at PNR Import_4.jpg" style="height: 353px; width: 344px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-Depth%20Look%20at%20PNR%20Import.33.1.5.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p><span><b>Step 4:</b> </span>Enter the desired Record Locator and be sure the Agent Sine default is complete, or enter your Agent Sine, and click <span class="span_2">Import PNR</span>. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 5: </span>Multiple reservations may be included in one PNR, therefore multiple reservations may be imported as a result of the PNR import. All segments of an air itinerary are imported into one reservation, but additional car and hotel reservations are imported into separate reservation records. </p>
        <p><span><b>Step 6:</b> </span>A reservation imported into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> must link to an existing vendor profile within your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database. To locate the appropriate vendor profile and automatically link to it, the system uses the Interface ID within the CRS and matches to an Interface ID within your Vendor profiles. If it finds a vendor profile with the same Interface ID, it imports the reservation automatically. If it does not find the Interface ID, then a prompt appears indicating the Interface ID it could not find. Click <span class="span_2">Query for Vendor by Name</span> and manually attach the reservation to the proper vendor profile by using the Query screen. If the vendor is not yet in your database, then use <span class="span_2">Create New Vendor</span> to add the vendor profile accordingly. <span>Special Note: </span>Avoid accidentally creating duplicate vendor profiles by making sure Interface ID's are captured properly within the vendor profiles you work with frequently.</p>
        <p><span><b>Step 7:</b> </span>All reservations imported via PNR Import default to <span class="span_2">Invoiced Outside CB+</span> as we assume you are using Worldspan to generate the invoice and/or ticket and interface record to your back office system. If you choose to generate the invoice from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, remove the check from this field in the reservation.</p>
