            <MadCap:keyword term="Res Card Manager Overview">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Using the Res Card Manager to Manage Your Res Cards</h1>
        <p class="p_2">This section details the use of the Res Card Manager to easily organize and manage reservation and trip data stored neatly in Res Cards.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the Res Card Manager is to automate the filing cabinet which has historically contained hundreds of paper index cards and file folders that have for years cluttered agencies. In the past, agents often entered details of leisure type reservations (client information, confirmation numbers, itineraries, vendor information, remarks, etc.) on cards or paper. Agents kept these cards somewhere on their desks or somewhere in their files. That “somewhere” translated into precious time spent searching for the reservation information, especially when the booking agent was not available and someone else needed to locate the information. As agents begin automating their non-CRS reservation information into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Cards, the Res Card Manager provides a tool to organize and manage the entire database of Res Card records. Imagine viewing all active Res Cards with the click of a button.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Res Cards Queries">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Query Your Database of Res Cards</h2>
        <p>When opening the Res Card Manager, by default no Query filters are entered, therefore, all active Res Cards in the database appear in the Query results screen. Each line represents one Res Card which in turn represents one trip. To filter the database results, either click a folder containing a stored set of Query fields, or use Level 1, Level 2, or Level Query fields to filter the database. </p>
        <p class="p_3">ResCard Manager</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 Using the Res Card Manager/Using the Res Card Manager.jpg" style="height: 329px;width: 566px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20the%20Res%20Card%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Res%20Cards.34.1.1.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>A list of Query folders is located in the Res Card Manager. The global folders are accessible to anyone for general viewing. They include Active, Departed and Cancelled Res Cards, and any folders with a customized set of Query filters (see section below <span class="span_2">Saving Queries for Easy Access</span>). Personal folders contain saved queries created by users and customized for their own particular user login. By clicking any of these folders, see the completed filters used for this stored Query, and a listing on the results screen of all profiles meeting the criteria of the selected Query filters.</p>
        <p class="p_4">By right-mouse clicking in the results screen, access the ability to Modify, Delete a Res Card, Refresh the Query, Invert all, Select all, Unselect all, and Modify Columns.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Res Card Manager Level 1 Query">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Level 1 Res Card Manager Query</h3>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 Using the Res Card Manager/Chapter 15 Using the Res Card Manager.jpg" style="height: 118px;width: 490px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20the%20Res%20Card%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Res%20Cards.34.1.2.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>The Level 1 Res Card Manager Query provides a way to quickly locate a Res Card or a group of Res Cards by simply completing one or two Query filters. </p>
        <p>The drop-down menu fields identify what to search <span class="span_2">by</span> and are completed by selecting from the following: <span class="span_2">Agent Name, Trip Name, Status, Reservation Cycle, Source of Booking, Locator No., Group Name, Region.</span> The defaults for these two fields are <span class="span_2">Agent Name</span> and <span class="span_2">Status. </span></p>
        <p>The blank field allows you to make a selection from a default pull-down list, or type in free-flow information if there is no pull-down list. To prevent spelling errors, it is suggested to type no more than 3 or 4 characters in the free-flow fields. An arrow to the right of the blank field indicates a list from a pull-down menu exists. If both fields are used in the Query, then the results match both (All) criteria, not either/or (Any). This means the Query filters are strung together with an “and” not an “or.” After completing or changing data in the filters, the system automatically sifts through the database and displays the matching profiles in the Query results screen.</p>
        <p>For example, if agent Sharon wants to review all her active Res Cards in the system, she sets the first field to <span class="span_2">Agent Name</span> and selects the name <span class="span_2">Sharon</span> from the pull-down menu list. She sets the second field to <span class="span_2">Status</span> and selects “Active” from the pull-down menu. Finally, she clicks on <span class="span_2">Refresh </span>to see a list of all her active Res Cards in the system. </p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Res Card Manager  Level 2 Query">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Level 2 Res Card Manager Query</h3>
        <p>The Query Level 2 provides additional filters to more narrowly define a search. Search filters are selected by clicking <span class="span_2">Filter, </span>and then completing as many of the search criteria fields as desired. </p>
        <p>The Query screen is divided into three Query levels or layers that move from more general information at the Res Card level to very specific, detailed search criteria at the service provider level.</p>
        <p class="p_3">1. ResCard</p>
        <p class="p_3">2. Reservation Level</p>
        <p class="p_3">3. Service Provider </p>
        <h4>RES CARD TAB</h4>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 Using the Res Card Manager/Chapter 15 Using the Res Card Manager_1.jpg" style="height: 363px;width: 522px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20the%20Res%20Card%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Res%20Cards.34.1.3.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>1. <span>Res Card Level</span>: Except for selecting the date range to search by, the trip name and Locator #, all other search fields have a pull-down menu indicated by the arrow to the right of the field for easy selection. User-defined fields are underscored and appear in blue print (Reservation Cycle, Source of booking, Group and Region). The Res Card Query level is composed of broader Query fields and generally includes a greater number of Res Cards in the Query results screen.</p>
        <p>2. <span>Reservation Level: </span>The reservation Query level fields focus on the specific components of the reservation - <span class="span_2">Travel Category</span>, <span class="span_2">Vendor,</span><span class="span_2">Reservation Status</span> and <span class="span_2">Payment Information</span>. </p>
        <p>3. <span>Service Provider Level: </span>The fields at the service provider level, when completed, can be extremely helpful as a quick reference when a customer calls in requesting information on a particular reservation. These fields also serve as useful reporting fields to tell an agency which service providers are the most frequently used. Having this information can be very helpful when negotiating overrides with service providers or reviewing the use of preferred vendors with agents. From travel category and beginning and ending dates of specific reservations such as cars and hotels, to individual client preferences such as cabin or dining preferences, these fields very narrowly define the query. </p>
        <h4>PROFILE TAB</h4>
        <p>Use general profile data as filters when running a Level 2 Query in the Res Card Manager. Query by profile to locate Res Cards and print results, as well as enhance your ability to query lists of Res Cards.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Res Card Manager Level 3 Query">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Level 3 Res Card Manager Query </h3>
        <p>The Query Level 3 provides users with an even greater ability to more narrowly define a search. As detailed above, Level 2 Query allows a search by any number of fields, stringing one statement of criteria together with an "and." Query Level 3 strings multiple statements of criteria together with an "or," using search method options to define how the criteria should filter. </p>
        <p>The Level 3 Query has a totally different look from Level 2 Query:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 Using the Res Card Manager/Chapter 15 Using the Res Card Manager.png" style="height: 179px;width: 624px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>There are a set of buttons including <span class="span_2">Add Filter, </span><span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter, </span><span class="span_2">Modify Filter, Delete Filter, Reset All</span> (to clear out all filters currently displayed), and <span class="span_2">Summarize</span>. Notice there is nothing to view in the results screen. This is because you need to setup the criteria statement(s) and click Refresh to see the Level 3 Query results. </p>
        <p><span>Note: </span>It is not necessary to completely re-enter the criteria when adding similar filters. Once the first filter has been added to a Level 3 query, the <span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter</span> button is enabled. When clicked, a Level 3 query screen is opened, pre-populated with all of the criteria from the selected filter. Users can also right-click on a filter and select <span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter</span>.</p>
        <p>To enter the search criteria into Level 3 Query after clicking <span class="span_2">Reset All</span>, click <span class="span_2">Add Filter</span>: </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 15 Using the Res Card Manager/To enter the search criteria.jpg" style="height: 377px;width: 521px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20the%20Res%20Card%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Res%20Cards.34.1.5.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Res Card folder tabs, <span class="span_2">Res Cards </span>and <span class="span_2">General Info appear.</span> What is unique about the Level 3 Query is that most of the available search fields are divided into two parts. Directly to the left of the field, is a box with a drop-down menu of search method options called, Operators, with which you can narrow down your search. Sample Operators include: <span class="span_2">Is Equal to; Less than or Equal to; Greater than or Equal to; Less than, Greater than, Not Equal to; Starts With; Contains; Is BLANK; </span><span>and</span><span class="span_2"> Is NOT BLANK.</span> Search fields are strung together with an <span class="span_2">And. </span>Use both tabs to setup the first filter or your query, and click <span class="span_2">OK. </span>Click <span class="span_2">Refresh</span> to see the results of your first filter. </p>
        <p>To set up a second filter, click <span class="span_2">Add. </span>Remember as you are setting up subsequent filters, there is an OR between all the filters you are stringing together, and you will not get results unless you click <span class="span_2">Refresh</span>. </p>
        <h3>Using Date Formulas in Queries</h3>
        <p>Since queries can be saved and retrieved for frequent use, the date fields in all queries allow for date formulas. This means any field that has a date, can also contain a formula for that date. The date formula function allows you to create a query without identifying a specific month, day and year in the <span class="span_2">From</span> and <span class="span_2">To</span> date fields. Instead, the query is processed with a formula for the month, day, day of the week, and year based upon the date the report is processed. </p>
        <p><span>Remember: </span>Make sure system date and time are correct.</p>
        <p><span>Benefit</span>: When entering a date formula, the system converts it to the intended time period to run queries and/or save them for future use without the need to modify dates.</p>
        <p><span>Example:</span> The following tables contain sample formulas for specifying dates. Mix and match the absolute and relative parameters in the function. The first number specifies the day of the month, the second number specifies the month, and the third number specifies the year. So if you only have the first number filled in, this means you intend this report to reoccur on this day every month, in every year.</p>

        <h2>Saving Queries for Easy Access</h2>
        <p>As you can see, queries run in the ResCard Manager can become quite complex. With all the available filters in Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, you can view your database inside out, upside down or in just about any subset. With this in mind, if there are certain queries that you want to run often, we suggest saving the Query filters after setting them up, by saving the Query to a folder. The next time you want to run a Query that you have already set up, click the saved folder. One click and your Query filters are completed automatically. What a time saver!</p>
        <h4>steps for saving a Res Card Query</h4>
        <p>1) Using Level 1, 2, or 3 filter parameters in the Res Card Manager, enter your Query filters and run your Query.</p>
        <p>2) To customize the columns used in the Query, click <span class="span_2">Columns</span> on the Res Card Manager results screen.</p>

        </p>
        <p>To relocate a column, hold the mouse over the column in the column header to move (see a vertical line extending down). Press the left mouse button and pull the column left or right to its new location. To "quick" sort results differently, hold down the shift key and click the column header you want the results sorted by. A triangle appearing in the up position signifies the results are currently sorted in ascending order, and a triangle in the down position signifies the results are sorted in descending order. </p>
        <p>3) When satisfied with the query results, go to <span>File|Save Query As</span>. This screen appears:</p>

        </p>
        <p>4) From the drop-down level menu, select <span class="span_2">Personal</span> (for your own use only), or <span class="span_2">Global</span> (for the use of everyone in the Agency).</p>
        <p>5) Name the query, to recognize it the next time it’s needed.</p>
        <p>6) Click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to save and see the new query folder located on the left hand side of the Res Card Manager screen.</p>
        <p><span>Note:</span><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> saves the selected filters and results layout, <span>not</span> the query results. The next time a saved query is used, any new data that has been added since it was created, is included in the new query. </p>
        <h2>Working with Query Results </h2>
        <p>Our most productive agent, Sharon, begins each day by accessing her to-do list. Immediately after working that list, she clicks on the Res Card Manager tab and selects <span class="span_2">Sharon’s Active Res Card</span> folder to review any pending reservations. The results screen immediately displays an organized list for her to review and take any action necessary. In addition to the active Res Cards, Sharon also created folders with saved sets of query filters labeled <span class="span_2">Leads, Booked </span>and <span class="span_2">Under Deposit</span> based on the reservation cycle fields. Having her Res Cards organized in this way helps her move closer to a goal of closing every travel inquiry that comes her way. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>An agent can view the Res Card and its details by double-clicking on it. Toggling from each Res Card to the profile and back is simple and quick. From the profile, access phone information, as well as, other key data that add a personal touch necessary for effective customer service. Click the Res Card or activities tab of the profile to refresh your memory on previous contacts with the client. </p>
        <p>Add, view, or delete a Res Card from this area of the profile. Add a new Res Card by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>; modify or enhance a existing Res Card (perhaps add a reservation to a trip) clicking <span class="span_2">Modify;</span> and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span> to remove a Res Card.</p>
        <h2>How to Multi-Select How to Multi-Select Records</h2>
        <p>To multi-select records from the results of a Query, use the CTRL key in combination with a mouse click. Notice one of three symbols next to each profile: </p>
        <p>a) <span>Bullet</span> - This profile has been selected.</p>
        <p>b) <span>Bullet and Bracket</span> - This profile has been selected and is the current profile record the cursor is focused. </p>
        <p>c) <span>Solid Triangle</span> - This profile has NOT been selected as part of the multi-select, but is the current record the cursor is focused on. CTRL-click once to get the bullet and bracket, and a second time to NOT include in the multi-select. </p>
        <p>Use the main edit menu or right-mouse click results screen to <span class="span_2">Select</span><span class="span_2">All</span>, <span class="span_2">Unselect All</span> or<span class="span_2"> Inverse</span> the selection.</p>
        <p><span>Note: </span>To delete multiple Res Cards, use the multi-select feature, and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>. This permanently deletes these highlighted records all at one time.</p>
