            <MadCap:keyword term="Other Profiles Overview">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles</h1>
        <p class="p_2">This chapter familiarizes you with how to setup, maintain and use Other Profiles.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Other profiles are used for gathering information and maintaining histories on individuals and companies that do not fit into one of the other profile categories. They are not leisure or corporate customers, vendors, or agents but are non-travel related individuals and companies with whom you do business. The landlord, bank, utility companies, insurance provider and printing company are all examples of “other” profiles. </p>
        <p>Why would you want to collect information on other profiles? When these profiles are carefully maintained, you always have current information for billing purposes and running labels. When you need help or a special favor from one of these entities, it is always helpful to have the name of the contact person handy. </p>
        <h2>Anatomy of an Other Profile</h2>
        <p>Other profiles in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> store an unlimited amount of information about your other contacts. To organize all this information and make it easily accessible to all agents, each profile is made up of seven key areas (Toolbar, Header Info, Scrolling Arrows, Control Buttons, Information Tabs, and User-Defined Fields).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other.jpg" style="height: 354px;width: 572px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.01.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Let’s explore each of these seven key areas:</p>
        <h3>Toolbar</h3>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_1.jpg" style="height: 65px;width: 482px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.02.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p><span>Website: </span>If you have entered a website for this profile and made it <span class="span_2">Primary </span>under <span class="span_2">Website </span>(in the communication area), you can launch the website, by clicking on this icon on the toolbar. </p>
        <p><span>Create a Reminder:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Remind</span> to create a Reminder for the other entity. An other reminder might be to pay the rent early this month. Fill in the date you wish to be reminded, set the priority, reminder type, set an optional alarm and finally type in some free-flowing remarks for reference. There is an option to mark this Reminder “Private” so that only the creation agent or SYSDBA can view it. This Reminder appears on queries in the activity manager or reports.</p>
        <p><span>Create a Note:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Note</span> to create an note documenting contacts you have with an other entity. By entering the date, time, and subject of the contact, a history of contacts is created which appears in the activity manager or reports.</p>
        <p><span>Create a Mailer:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Mailer</span> to create a mailer documenting mailings sent to an Other entity. By entering the date, time, and subject of the mailer, a history of mailers is created which appears in the activity manager or reports.</p>
        <p><span>Print:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Print</span> to print out details of the other profile.</p>
        <p><span>Merge to Label</span>: Click <span class="span_2">Label</span> to create a label for the other profile.</p>
        <p><span>Merge to Document Template:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Letter</span> to merge other name and address to any letter contained in the document templates. The letter can be customized if desired by the user for a personalized touch.</p>
        <p><span>Merge to E-mail:</span> Click <span class="span_2">E-mail</span> to merge the primary e-mail address for this other profile into a e-mail screen. Complete the e-mail.</p>
        <p class="p_3">Header Information</p>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_2.jpg" style="height: 92px;width: 623px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.03.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>The header conveniently displays pertinent information such as primary address and primary communication information (telephone number, fax, website and e-mail addresses), Primary Contact, Groups, Created date, Salutation, Interface ID, and Profile No. Frequently confirm the accuracy of this information to ensure data is always up-to-date. Clicking any field label (including address info) in the header automatically jumps you to that field for quick edits.</p>
        <h3>Scrolling Arrows</h3>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_3.jpg" style="height: 104px;width: 58px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.04.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>The four black arrows provides navigation to move among the profiles included within the current Query in the results screen. </p>
        <h3>Profile Indicator</h3>
        <p class="p_4">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_4.jpg" style="height: 56px;width: 58px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.05.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>An indicator to the right of the arrows appears if an open Reminder alerts you that some future action is scheduled to take place. </p>
        <p class="p_3">Control Buttons</p>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_5.jpg" style="height: 92px;width: 75px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.06.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Close:</span> Takes you out of the profile and only appears if there are no unsaved changes made to the profile.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">O.K.:</span> Saves any information that has been added, modified or deleted and exits the profile.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Apply: </span>Saves any information that has been added, modified or deleted and keeps you in the profile.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Cancel:</span> Appears only if the profile has changes that have not been saved, abandons those changes and then exits the profile.</p>
        <h3>Information Tabs</h3>
        <p>Each other profile contains the following information tabs: <span class="span_2">General Info, Communications, Remarks, Contact, Activities, Attachments, and Groups. </span>The section below, <span class="span_2">Detailed Review of Folders</span>, describes each tab in detail.</p>
        <h3>User-Defined Fields</h3>
        <p>There are many fields in other profiles that can be customized for agency use. While data entry fields are usually labeled in black, user-defined fields stand out because they are labeled in blue. If you have permission, double-click on the blue label or go to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields</span>, to add, modify, or delete these field items for use by agents in the form of drop-down menus. </p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Other Profiles Folders">&#160;</MadCap:keyword>Detailed Review of Other Folders</h2>
        <p class="p_3">General Info Tab </p>
        <h3>The General Information folder displays other information. </h3>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_6.jpg" style="height: 374px;width: 578px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.07.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Use the &lt;Tab&gt; key to move from field to field and &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; to move backwards from field to field; or use your mouse and click the desired field to enter data. The following fields are in the General Information folder:</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Type:</span> This field defaults to other.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Name: </span>Enter the name of other profile. Any printed reports or labels include the <span class="span_2">Other</span> name entered in the General Info folder.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Last Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the last name of primary contact. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">First Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the first name of the primary contact.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Middle</span><span>:</span> Enter the middle name of the Primary Contact.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Courtesy Title</span><span>:</span> Mr., Mrs., Mr. &amp; Mrs., Ms., Dr. are all examples of courtesy titles. The drop-down menu allows you to select from a lengthy standardized list. This courtesy title is printed on mail labels. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Address 1, Address 2:</span> A vendor profile includes an unlimited number of addresses designated as Primary, Bill To, Ship To, Second Address and Alternate Address. Only one address though may be assigned as Primary, Bill To, or Ship To.</p>
        <p>Assuming the address to be captured is the default type of <span class="span_2">Primary, Bill To </span>and <span class="span_2">Ship To</span>, then the address fields of <span class="span_2">Address Line 1</span>, <span class="span_2">Address Line 2</span>, <span class="span_2">Apt/Suite, Zip Code, City, State </span>and <span class="span_2">Country </span>can be entered right from the main screen. To capture additional address entries, such as a second address or alternate address, click <span class="span_2">Additional Addresses</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Apt/Suite:</span> Enter the appropriate unit number.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">City/State/Zip:</span> Enter the city/state/zip data. These fields can be customized by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|City/State/Zip </span>or click on the blue field label.</p>
        <h4>PROFILE STATUS</h4>
        <p><span class="span_2">Create Date/Create User:</span> These fields default to the system date and the user logged in at the time the profile is created. Both can be modified, but can be disabled by the database administrator. Agencies use this field to query for new customers so that “Welcome to the Agency" letters can be mailed. These fields can also be used to query for management reports reflecting user productivity in creating new client profiles. </p>
        <p><span>Last Modified User/Last Modified Date: </span>This area indicates the last time a profile was modified and by whom.</p>
        <p><span>Profile Status: </span>Indicate whether a customer profile is active or inactive by choosing from the drop-down menu. By default all profiles start with an active status. An inactive status has been included, since you cannot delete a profile that has invoices and payments attached. When querying, only profiles marked as active are included in the search, but you can perform a Level 2 search to view inactive profiles.</p>
        <h4>ADDITIONAL INFO</h4>
        <p><span class="span_2">Branch No.:</span> For agencies with multiple branches, enter the branch number (if applicable) from the drop-down menu. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Interface ID</span><span>: </span>N/A.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Salutation:</span> The name used to greet the contact; for example, if Mr. Henry Wilkenson likes to be called “Hank,” enter <span class="span_2">Hank</span> in this field. If Mrs. Emily Anderson likes to be called “Mrs. Anderson,” enter <span class="span_2">Mrs. Anderson</span> in this field.</p>
        <h4>SPECIAL DATES</h4>
        <p>These fields are particularly useful to record unique dates for each specific customer. Enter the day/month/year (or any combination of these date fields) of the special date and choose the type by clicking the drop-down menu. Items in this list can be customized by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Special Dates</span>, or click on the blue label in the profile. Imagine the marketing possibilities when several months before an anniversary or vacation time, your agency suggests as a gift a trip reflecting the client’s preferences. By clicking <span class="span_2">Additional Special Dates</span>, unlimited dates can be added. </p>
        <h3>Communications Tab</h3>
        <p>If you were on a previous version of ClientBase, communications have been moved out of the General Info tab of the Contact record into its own tab. The Primary Phone, Primary E-mail, Primary Fax, and Primary Web are now displayed in the list of Contacts on the Contacts tab in the profile. The first Communication entry of a given type is marked as the Contact's Primary (Primary box checked). Subsequent communication entries of that type default to unchecked. </p>
        <p>By using the radio button on the top of the results screen, users can filter to view only one communications type at a time. Profile-level communication entries are displayed first, followed by the communications that are assigned to contacts. Contact communications are in the order that the contacts are listed in the Contacts tab. Profile level communications can be sorted using the blue arrows on the right side of the screen. These arrows are disabled when a Contact communication entry is selected. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Add, Modify, </span>or <span class="span_2">Delete</span> a communication entry. Deleting a communication entry works the same as before, unless the Contact is linked to more than one profile. In that case, the user is warned, <span class="span_2">This traveler is associated with multiple profiles. Deleting this communication will remove entry from those profiles also. Delete?</span> </p>
        <h4>ADDING A COMMUNICATION ENTRY</h4>
        <p>Click <span class="span_2">Add </span>to start:</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Contact:</span> Select the name of the contact from the drop-down. When adding a communication entry from the Contact level, there is no option to change the contact name by drop-down. </p>
        <p><span class="span_4">Type:</span> From the drop-down select the communication type - <span class="span_2">Phone, Fax, E-mail, Web Site, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google+. (</span>The standardized format for telephone, fax, e-mail and website entries in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides a platform upon which these numbers can be quickly moved among toolbar icons such as merging to e-mail, or merge to PNR.) </p>
        <p>Each <span class="span_2">phone </span>entry has a forced canonical country code and area code for the benefits of standardization described above. The prefix and suffix fields of the phone number field remain free-flow to accommodate foreign numbers. Maintain a default country code and area code in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults |Communication Defaults</span>. When entering new phone entries, if the country code and area code is not completed, the system defaults to the country code and area code in the Global Defaults. </p>
        <p class="p_4">Example Formats for capturing user's social media information:</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Facebook: </span>For a profile - facebook.com/username (facebook.com/JohnSmith); For a page - facebook.com/page name (facebook.com/SabreTravel)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Twitter:</span> Twitter.com/username (Twitter.com/JohnSmith)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Linked In:</span> linkedin.com/pub/8/b8a/205</p>
        <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Linked In ID)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Google Plus:</span> plus.google.com/117474227900375467167</p>
        <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Google+ ID)</p>
        <p>Just like all other communication types, social media communication types have a Marketing Permission checkbox. Marketing Permission is unchecked by default.</p>
        <p>The social media Communication Types are in the Level 2 and Level 3 queries.</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Primary</span><span>:</span> One entry for each of these types can be designated as primary. Though an unlimited number of entries can be stored and viewed, the primary entries are marked with an asterisk on the main screen and included in export routines and used for merge to e-mail.</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Marketing Permission</span><span>:</span> All current e-mail addresses within the database default to this field being checked if setup by the database administrator in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|Communication Defaults</span>. On an e-mail entry by e-mail entry basis, choose to leave it checked or unchecked. This marketing permission checkbox is accessible through the global modify feature. So if you want the existing e-mail entries to have this permission marketing field unchecked, use global modify. </p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Invalid</span><span>:</span> This area is for use by a marketing organization or marketing person within the agency that has received something back as undeliverable. Rather than deleting the address or e-mail entirely from the database without the proper research, the marketing person can check the Invalid box signaling the fact that the agent should look into this further, but leaves it to the agent to determine how to update. Level 2 and Level 3 Profile Manager Queries have been updated to include the ability to filter profiles based on this address or e-mail Invalid status. Agencies should use these queries periodically to see if they have any Invalid addresses or e-mails that need updating. In the meantime, any addresses and e-mails with this Invalid setting will still be included in all Merge To features and reports.</p>
        <p>Need to copy a communication’s entry?&#160; Right-click on the entry and select <span class="span_2">Copy Phone, Copy E-Mail, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Copy Fax.&#160; </span>Then paste the entry into other applications as needed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Remarks Tab</h3>
        <p>The Remarks folder provides a full-page view of the unlimited remarks and provides tremendous flexibility for entering comments into the other profile. The only limitation in the <span class="span_2">Remarks</span> folder is the amount of available disk space. View any miscellaneous comments from this screen. A mini-word processor is available from this area allowing an agency to customize free-flowing remarks:</p>
        <h3>Contacts Tab</h3>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Contact </span>folder is designed for detailed information on specific individuals who are key contacts within a profile. The blue up-and-down arrows allow re-ordering the list of Contacts. Other profiles have a "Reset Sorting" button which returns the list to alphabetical order. By highlighting a particular contact, you’ll be able to see any remarks entered in the contact record.</p>
        <p>Add a new traveler/contact by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. When a user adds a new contact record, the database is first automatically searched for any existing travelers/contacts that match. If a match is found, the user can select the existing contact from the list presented and click <span class="span_2">Link </span>to link the existing traveler/contact. They may also click <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> to return to their new traveler/contact. </p>
        <p>When clicking <span class="span_2">OK</span> again, the new traveler/contact is created. Any data that was entered while creating the new traveler/contact that did not exist in the linked traveler/contact record will be transferred.</p>
        <p><span>Example:</span> An agent enters a passport number when entering a new traveler/contact. The agent clicks OK, and search finds an existing traveler/contact record, but the existing record does not have a passport number. When the agent selects the matching traveler/contact record, and data from the traveler/contact record is populated on the screen, the passport information that was missing is now completed also.</p>
        <p><span>Conversely:</span> If data was entered and the existing traveler/contact record contains information in that field, the existing traveler/contact data is retained. <span class="span_2">Example:</span> Agent enters First Name, Last Name, and a birthdate of July 1, 1960, and then clicks OK. The traveler/contact Search results screen appears, and the agent decides to select one of the existing traveler/contact records. The existing traveler has a birthdate of April 12, 1965. The existing birthdate information overwrites the one the agent entered. (Users can always go back and edit if the original information was incorrect.)</p>
        <p>To modify or enhance a contact, click <span class="span_2">Modify</span> while the name is highlighted. If <span class="span_2">Unlink</span> is clicked for a traveler/contact that is not linked to any other profiles, then a prompt is presented warning that the traveler/contact will be deleted completely. If <span class="span_2">Unlink</span> is clicked for a traveler/contact that is linked to more than one profile, then a confirmation prompt is presented, advising that the traveler/contact will continue to exist in the other linked profiles. </p>
        <p>By click the <span class="span_2">Search </span>button, you can search for a contact that is located in another profile and attach the contact to this profile as well. </p>
        <h4>TRAVELER/CONTACT RECORD</h4>
        <p>There are 8 tabs of information in a traveler/contact record - <span class="span_2">General, Communications, Addresses, Advanced Contact Info, Cards, Travel Preferences, PNR Entries, and Associated Profiles. </span>Let’s take a look at how to organize information for each contact by going through each field of the add/modify screen. </p>
        <p>Notice the header in the Contact record, similar to the header of a profile. It displays Contact Name, Address, Communications, Salutation/Nickname, Relationship/Position, Department, Age, Primary Traveler indicator, Associated Profiles, and Birthday and Expired Credit Card/Passport notification icons.</p>
        <p>These two icons in the header are visual alerts of important dates:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_7.jpg" style="height: 118px;width: 72px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.08.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>A birthday present icon appears during the contact's birthday month and disappears once the birthday month has passed. A red exclamation point icon appears if the traveler has an expired passport or credit card. Clicking on the exclamation point icon takes the user to Card record if it's an expired credit card, or to the Advanced Traveler Info tab if it's an expired passport. The icon disappears when the expiration date is updated. </p>
        <h4>GENERAL TAB in Contact Record</h4>
        <p><span class="span_2">Position: </span>By choosing from a drop-down menu, these user-definable items can be inserted.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Courtesy Title</span><span>:</span> Mr., Mrs., Mr. &amp; Mrs., Ms., Dr. are all examples of courtesy titles. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">First Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the legal first name of the contact in this field. This provides correct information for booking purposes. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Middle Name*: </span>Enter the legal middle name (for international traveling purposes).</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Last Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the legal last name of contact. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Gender*: </span>Select contact gender from the drop-down menu.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Citizenship*: </span>Enter contact’s citizenship from the user-definable drop-down menu<span>.</span></p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Birthdate*</span><span>:</span> Enter contact’s birthdate including month, day and year, or any combination of those date fields. (If agent knows only month, enter it - you can query the database by month and send out birthday cards!)</p>
        <p><span>Age:</span> The Age field is auto-calculated based on the entries in the Birthdate fields. To auto-calculate the age, a year must be captured within the Birthdate and calculates based on the current date and the following logic: </p>
        <p>- If a year but no month and day is captured, the Age is calculated based on Jan 1st of the birth year.</p>
        <p>- If a month and year but no day is captured, the Age is calculated based on the 1st of the birth month and year.</p>
        <p>- If a day and year but no month is captured, the Age is calculated based on Jan as the birth month.</p>
        <p><span>Salutation/Nickname:</span> This field allows a salutation or nickname to be entered for each contact. The Salutation/Nickname can be viewed in the Profile Manager results by adding the column to the Query screen. </p>
        <p><span>Department:</span> In profiles, this is a field to enter the contact’s department.</p>
        <p><span>Primary Contact: </span>Click here if this is the primary contact for this profile. By default, the box is checked for the contact added to the profile, designating them as Primary. For subsequent contacts added, the box is unchecked by default. If a user checks the box when adding a new contact, making them Primary, the box automatically will be unchecked for the original primary contact. There can be only one Primary Contact per profile. </p>
        <p><span>Remarks:</span> Enter unlimited free-flowing information pertaining to this contact.</p>
        <h4>COMMUNICATION TAB in Contact Record</h4>
        <p>By using the radio button on the top of the results screen, filter to view only one communications type at a time. Sort communications using the blue arrows on the right side of the screen. <span class="span_2">Add, Modify, </span>or <span class="span_2">Delete</span> a communication entry. Deleting a communication entry works the same as before, unless the contact is linked to more than one profile. In that case, the user is warned, <span class="span_2">This contact is associated with multiple profiles. Deleting this communication will remove entry from those profiles also. Delete?</span> </p>
        <h4>ADDING A COMMUNICATION ENTRY</h4>
        <p>Click <span class="span_2">Add </span>to start:</p>
        <p><span class="span_4">Type:</span> From the drop-down select the communication type - <span class="span_2">Phone, Fax, E-mail, Web Site, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google+. (</span>The standardized format for telephone, fax, e-mail and website entries in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides a platform upon which these numbers can be quickly moved among toolbar icons such as merging to e-mail, or merge to PNR.) </p>
        <p>Each <span class="span_2">phone </span>entry has a forced canonical country code and area code for the benefits of standardization described above. The prefix and suffix fields of the phone number field remain free-flow to accommodate foreign numbers. Maintain a default country code and area code in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults |Communication Defaults</span>. When entering new phone entries, if the country code and area code is not completed, the system defaults to the country code and area code in the Global Defaults. </p>
        <p class="p_4">Example Formats for capturing user's social media information:</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Facebook: </span>For a profile - facebook.com/username (facebook.com/JohnSmith); For a page - facebook.com/page name (facebook.com/SabreTravel)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Twitter:</span> Twitter.com/username (Twitter.com/JohnSmith)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Linked In:</span> linkedin.com/pub/8/b8a/205</p>
        <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Linked In ID)</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Google Plus:</span> plus.google.com/117474227900375467167</p>
        <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Google+ ID)</p>
        <p>Just like all other communication types, social media communication types have a Marketing Permission checkbox. Marketing Permission is unchecked by default.</p>
        <p>The social media Communication Types are in the Level 2 and Level 3 queries, as well as the Client Survey report.</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Primary</span><span>:</span> One entry for each of these types can be designated as primary. Though an unlimited number of entries can be stored and viewed, the primary entries are marked with an asterisk on the main screen and included in export routines and used for merge to e-mail.</p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Marketing Permission</span><span>:</span> All current e-mail addresses within the database default to this field being checked if setup by the database administrator in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|Communication Defaults</span>. On an e-mail entry by e-mail entry basis, choose to leave it checked or unchecked. This marketing permission checkbox is accessible through the global modify feature. So if you want the existing e-mail entries to have this permission marketing field unchecked, use global modify. </p>
        <p><span class="span_3">Invalid</span><span class="span_3">:</span> This area is for use by a marketing organization or marketing person within the agency that has received something back as undeliverable. Rather than deleting the address or e-mail entirely from the database without the proper research, the marketing person can check the Invalid box signaling the fact that the agent should look into this further, but leaves it to the agent to determine how to update. Level 2 and Level 3 Profile Manager Queries have been updated to include the ability to filter profiles based on this address or e-mail Invalid status. Agencies should use these queries periodically to see if they have any Invalid addresses or e-mails that need updating. In the meantime, any addresses and e-mails with this Invalid setting will still be included in all Merge To features and reports.</p>
        <h4>ADDRESS TAB in Contact Record </h4>
        <p>Contacts can only have one address. Contact Address fields were also added to Select Columns and Sort By Columns in Profile Manager query results screens. </p>
        <p><span>Address Line 1: </span>Enter an address line for this contact.</p>
        <p><span>Address Line 2: </span>Enter an additional address line if applicable for this contact.</p>
        <p><span>Apt/Suite: </span>Enter the apartment of suite number.</p>
        <p><span>Zip Code: </span>Enter zip code. This Zip Code entry auto-populates the City and State fields if this is set up in User Defined Fields, as it does in Profile-level addresses.</p>
        <p><span>City: </span>Enter city.</p>
        <p><span>State: </span>Enter state.</p>
        <p><span>Description: </span>Free-flow a description for this address.</p>
        <p><span>Marketing Permission: </span>Contact addresses have their own marketing permission checkbox, which defaults to unchecked. </p>
        <h4>ADVANCED CONTACT INFO TAB in Contact Record</h4>
        <p><span class="span_2">Passport Number</span><span>:</span> For up to 2 passports, enter traveler’s passport number. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Expiration</span><span>:</span> Enter contact’s passport expiration date. This is a great field to Query on to send out letters alerting customers that passports are about to expire.</p>
        <p><span>Issue Date*:</span> Enter contact’s passport issue date. </p>
        <p><span>Issuing City*:</span> Enter contact’s passport issuing of origin from the user-definable drop-down menu).</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Issuing Country*</span><span>:</span> Enter contact’s passport issuing country of origin from the user-definable drop-down menu<span>.</span></p>
        <p>* Heightened security has increased the amount of traveler information agencies need to collect for international travel bookings:</p>
        <p><span>Redress Number/Known Traveler Number: </span>Use this area for TSA numbers assigned to contact.</p>
        <p><span>Emergency Contact: </span>Emergency Contact information includes Name, Phone Number and a Miscellaneous text field to capture any additional information about the emergency contact such as the relationship to the Contact. </p>
        <h4>CARDS TAB in Contact Record </h4>
        <p>Enter frequent flyer, credit card, cruise program, and miscellaneous card information pertaining to this contact. All cards entered at the contact level also appear within the listing of cards at the profile level. Click <span class="span_2">Add</span> to enter a new card:</p>
        <p><span>Card Type/Card Code/Card Description: </span>Card types are <span class="span_2">Credit Card, Frequent Flyer, Hotel Program, Car Program, Car Program, Cruise Program, Other and Discount Card. </span></p>
        <p>The <span class="span_2">Discount Card</span> in the drop-down list of cards that can be selected in the Cards tab for use with discount programs such as AAA Memberships, AARP, etc. This card type is formatted exactly like all other card types (name, card type, card code, card description, number, expiration, etc.). By entering the <span class="span_2">Card Code, </span>the <span class="span_2">Card Description </span>is auto-filled.</p>
        <p><span>Merge to PNR: </span>By default any new credit card entries default to <span class="span_2">Use Global PNR Rule</span><span>.</span> With this setting credit cards continue to merge as they have in the past based on the global credit card PNR Rule. If this Merge to PNR setting is changed to <span class="span_2">Always</span>, then regardless of the global PNR Rule for credit cards, the credit card defaults to being selected on the Merge to PNR Selection Screen. If this Merge to PNR setting is changed to <span class="span_2">Optional</span>, then regardless of the global PNR Rule for credit cards, the credit card defaults to not being selected on the Merge to PNR Selection Screen. This feature gives you the ability to set the <span class="span_2">Always/Optional</span> setting at the credit card entry level as well as the Global Defaults level. </p>
        <p><span>Card Number/Expiration: </span>Enter the <span class="span_2">Card Number</span> without dashes and use the last day of the month it expires (<span class="span_2">Expiration)</span> in the correct year.</p>
        <p><span>Issued by/Remarks: </span>These are optional fields to put additional data.</p>
        <p><span>Name on Card: </span>The name on the card should default to the contact’s name. If someone else’s name is on the card, change it here.</p>
        <p><span>Upon saving or editing Credit Card numbers, </span><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span><span> validates the card number.</span> <span>Note: </span>Upon saving or edit a credit card number, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> now validates the card number. If the number is invalid, a prompt occur: <span class="span_2">The credit card number entered appears to have a typographical error or it is not a valid credit card. Do you want to continue saving this record?</span> This prompt serves as a warning that there may have been a data entry error (typo).</p>
        <p>Selecting <span>YES</span> saves the card As Is.</p>
        <p>Selecting <span>NO</span> returns user to the card number field.</p>
        <p>When editing an existing card number, validation does not occur unless the card number field is modified. Validation occurs in Profile Cards Tab, Invoice Form of Payment Credit Card and CC Merchant, Invoice Booking Payment Credit Card and CC Merchant, Reservation Payment Due Date tab, Receipt Form of Payment CC Merchant FOP.</p>
        <p>***Valid credit card numbers with spaces do not prompt</p>
        <p>***Valid credit card numbers with letters (VI1234123412341234) do not prompt</p>
        <p>***Valid credit card numbers with expiration date after a slash (CA5458004519231383 /1109) will not prompt (although we do not recommend entering the expiration date in the CardNumber field.)</p>
        <h4>TRAVEL PREFERENCES TAB in Contact Record</h4>
        <p>Under this tab each travel category appears in a new tree view. Travel Categories are listed in the tree on the left side and Travel Preferences for each are on the right. This gives the ability to capture travel preferences globally by Travel Category, but also the ability to capture travel preferences for each preferred Vendor. It is not mandatory to have preferred preferences for a preferred vendor. It is also not mandatory to select preferred vendors for a client. </p>
        <p>Click the Travel Category name to view and/or set up global travel preferences for the category. Preferences set up for the travel category will automatically default as the preferred preference for each preferred vendor selected for that category, however, the vendor preferences can be modified. </p>
        <p>To add a preferred vendor, click the <span class="span_2">Add</span> button at the bottom of the Travel Category tree. A <span class="span_2">Find Vendor</span> screen is displayed. Select the Travel Category and the Vendor and click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. Preferences are shown for the vendor based on the default preferences for the Travel Category. Make adjustments to the preferences as needed. </p>
        <p>A new field, <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> is available in preferences for future use with <span class="span_2">Sabre Graphical Profiles</span>. The <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> field is displayed when adding or viewing a preferred vendor. Desirability options appear as a drop down to select from. Selections are: <span class="span_2">Do Not Use, Dislikes, No Preference, Favorable, and Very Favorable.</span></p>
        <p>All Travel Categories now use the user defined field Special Options. For Air Preferences, Meal Preferences is named Meal Type which links to a Meal Code field that was also added. Air Craft Type is available as a preference. For Cruise Preferences, Ship Name and Departure Port are available as User Defined fields and are displayed as preference options. When using contact columns in queries, the default global preferences are displayed in the query.</p>
        <h4>PNR ENTRIES TAB in Contact Record</h4>
        <p>In order to capture contact-related PNR entries (such as general remarks, special meal requests, air/car/hotel preference, UDID’s, etc.), a tab is included in the contact record for leisure and corporate client profiles. </p>
        <h4>ASSOCIATED PROFILES TAB Contact Record</h4>
        <p>This tab allows the user to view all the profiles that a given contact is linked to. By clicking <span class="span_2">Open, </span>user has the ability to hop into another profile.</p>
        <h3>Linking a Contact Record to Another Profile</h3>

        <p class="p_4">Linking a Traveler/Contact Record:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_8.jpg" style="height: 238px;width: 420px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.09.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>1) Retrieve the desired profile to which you want to link a traveler/contact record. For example, you may want to link a leisure traveler/contact to a Corporate profile.</p>
        <p>2) Click the profile Traveler/Contact tab and <span class="span_2">Search</span>.</p>
        <p>3) Type in at least 2 pieces of data in the search fields and <span class="span_2">Search</span>. </p>
        <p>4) When the traveler/contact result comes up, click <span class="span_2">Link</span>.</p>
        <p>5) All the traveler/contact data is now in the new profile.</p>
        <p><span>TIPS: </span>Search by phone or e-mail address alone, or in combination with any of the name fields. If searching by name only, users must enter something in at least two of the three name fields.</p>
        <p class="p_4">Examples: </p>
        <p>**User enters First Name of Ken and an e-mail address of ken@example.com. Ken Able, who has that address, is returned; Ken Jones, who does not have that e-mail address, is not.</p>
        <p>**User knows the last name, but isn't sure exactly how the first name is spelled. He enters First Name A and last name Smith. All Travelers whose first name starts with A (Alice, Anne, Alex,) and last name starts with Smith (Smith, Smith-Jones) are returned.</p>
        <p>**User knows that Mary Anne Jones has married, but doesn't remember the Traveler's new last name. She enters First Name Mary and Middle Name Anne. All Travelers with that first and middle name are returned.</p>
        <p>**User knows the traveler's phone number and enters (650) 555-1212. All travelers with that phone number are returned. </p>
        <h3>Activities Tab</h3>
        <p>Anyone who has permission can see the history of notes, mailers, or reminders made with a specific other profile by clicking the Activities Tab. </p>
        <p>This tab displays a complete history of all contacts associated with this specific client. Included are Notes (record of interaction with client), Reminders (record of scheduled past and future activities) and Mailers (record detailing mailings sent to this client). To add a new Note, Reminder or Mailer, click <span class="span_2">Add</span>. To modify or enhance a Note, Reminder or Mailer click <span class="span_2">Modify</span> while the item is highlighted. Click <span class="span_2">Delete</span> while the item is highlighted to remove it.</p>
        <p>Notice the radio buttons located directly above the activities results screen. This allows for quick filtering of the results appearing in this tab. By default ALL activities are displayed, but options for viewing just Mailers, Notes, Reminders, or Open Reminders are available. Also, as you arrow through the various activities appearing in the Activities Tab, the remarks for each activity are displayed to the right of the windows just below Activity Details.</p>
        <h3>Attachment Tab</h3>
        <p>To enhance the amount and type of information accessible in a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile, a feature is included in all profile types allowing you to point to other files available on your local or network drive. These files are referred to as <span class="span_2">Attachments</span>.</p>
        <p>To access an attachment at the other level, click the <span class="span_2">Attachment Tab</span>. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 19 An In-Depth Look at Other Profiles/An In Depth Look at Other_9.jpg" style="height: 303px;width: 521px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Other%20Profiles.38.1.10.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>Attachments are listed alphabetically by <span class="span_2">Description</span>, and can be sorted from the drop-down menu by <span class="span_2">Description, File Name, Directory Path, Computer Name, Original File Source, Compressed Size, File Date/Time, or Modified Date/Time.</span></p>
        <p>To add a new attachment click <span class="span_2">Add</span>, and <span class="span_2">Browse for Attachment </span>to identity the File Path of the file. The File Path includes the drive where the file is located, any directories or sub-directories, and the name of the file. Choose to compress the file by clicking in the Compression box. Enter a brief description of the attachment, if desired. When retrieving a profile and viewing Attachments, the attachments are listed alphabetically by <span class="span_2">Description</span>.</p>
        <p><span>Note:</span> Although these file paths are created from one workstation, they are saved as part of your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database and so accessible from any <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> workstation.</p>
        <p>To view a saved attachment, highlight the attachment, and click the <span class="span_2">Open Attachment</span>, or double-click on attachment to open. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses Windows associations to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp,.html, etc.) must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as MS Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the attachment created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
        <p>Modifications to a file launched from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> attachments can be saved automatically back into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. If an attachment is opened and then modified and saved, upon closing the attachment you land on the attachment settings window. Clicking <span class="span_2">OK </span>from this area saves the newly modified file back to <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>, while the name is highlighted, to remove an attachment. <span class="span_2">Save As Attachment</span> allows you to save a copy of the attachment into another file location.</p>
        <h3>Groups Tab</h3>
        <p>Profiles may be associated with a specific group which has been created by the agency. There is no limit to how many groups one profile may be associated with. Enter a group(s) to which this profile belongs by clicking the drop-down menu item after clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. This group table is shared with <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>. Customize these items by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Groups: Other</span>, or by clicking the blue field label. To add a new group to the other’s profile, click <span class="span_2">Add</span>. To modify or enhance an group, click <span class="span_2">Modify</span> while the group is highlighted. Click <span class="span_2">Delete</span> while the group is highlighted to remove it.</p>
