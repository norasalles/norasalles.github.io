        <h1>Sabre Host Command Utility</h1>
        <p class="p_2">This section covers to use the Sabre Host Command Utility with Sabre Red 2.0.</p>
        <p class="p_2">*NOTE: Discontinued Product - Sabre Host Command Utility will continue to work and be supported until your agency is migrated to the new Sabre Red 360 (3.0) after that the connection will no longer work.*</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Agents (especially Corporate Agents) have become accustomed to working in the GDS screens and benefit from the efficiencies of using the native command line entries. For some, toggling to <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to query a profile and selecting for merging to a PNR is not a natural part of their current workflow and may cost them in key strokes which ultimately increases the time it takes to process certain transactions.</p>
        <p>This utility is designed to allow agents to maintain keyboard commands (no extra mouse work), using their native Sabre command line entries to query for <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profiles, view result lists, move a profile or traveler into their current PNR, and display the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> PNR selection window for viewing and accessing all profile PNR data including optional move entries.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this Sabre Red Workspace must be running so that a connection can be made to the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database via the Sabre Host Command Utility.</p>
        <h2>Set Up Sabre Red Workspace</h2>
        <p>Before using the Sabre Host Command Utility for the first time, launch Sabre Red Workspace and verify that the Sabre Emulator API is checked. This is found under <span>Tools|Agency Applications|Configure agency applications|Sabre System|Advanced</span>. The Sabre Host Command Utility cannot operate without the <span class="span_2">Sabre Emulator</span> <span class="span_2">API</span>.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Set Up the Sabre Host Command Utility</h2>
        <p>The Sabre Host Command Utility automatically installs the SabreInt.exe file in a Host Command folder when the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> installation file is run. The utility will launch each time the computer is started and an icon will sit in the system tray, letting you know that it is running.</p>
        <p>When the installation is complete, the utility will automatically open on your screen and an icon will sit in the system tray, letting you know the utility is running. Connect to the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database by logging into the utility.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><span>Connect To:</span> Select <span class="span_2">ClientBase Windows</span></p>
        <p><span>Alias Name:</span> Click the down-arrow and select the correct Alias. Once the Alias is chosen, the Alias Path is automatically completed.</p>
        <p><span>User Name/Password: </span>Enter your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> User Name and Password and click <span class="span_2">Login</span>. A message will appear confirming that the database is connected. </p>
        <p>Once connected, click the <span class="span_2">Hide</span> button. To view the utility screen again at any time, right-mouse click on the icon in the system tray and select Open. To completely close the utility, right-mouse click on the icon in the system tray and select <span class="span_2">Exit</span>.</p>
        <h2>ClientBase Query Commands</h2>
        <p>From the Sabre Red Workspace emulator, use the following command line entries to query profiles in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and display results, select a result to move into the current PNR and select a result to launch the Merge to PNR selection screen.</p>
        <p>To query for profiles there are two format options. Query by profile name or query by traveler/contact.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>Query by Name </h4>
        <p class="p_3">CBN*[Profile Name]-[Traveler Last/Traveler First][enter]</p>
        <p>Queries all client type profiles based on "starts with" type search operator and displays listing of matching records by Profile Name (if no traveler data entered) or by Traveler (if traveler data is entered) </p>
        <p class="p_3">Examples:</p>
        <p>CBN*ABC MANUFACTURING-USINISKI/JANET (displays profile that matches with the profile name and traveler name)</p>
        <p>CBN*ABC (displays one line per profile that matches with Profile Name starting with ABC)</p>
        <p>CBN*ABC-SMITH (displays one line per traveler that matches with profile name starting with ABC and traveler last name starting with Smith)</p>
        <p>CBN*JONES/MIKE (displays one line per profile that matches with profile name Jones/Mike)</p>
        <p>CBN*JONES/MIKE-JONES/TINA (displays one line per traveler/contact that matches with profile name Jones/Mike and traveler Jones/Tina)</p>
        <p>Profile information from the query results for each matching profile appears in following order:</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Profile Type, Profile Name, Last Name, First Name, Address 1, City, State, Primary Phone, Primary Email</span><span class="span_2"><br /></span>
        </p>
        <h4>Query by Traveler</h4>
        <p class="p_3">CBP*[Traveler Last]/[Traveler First][enter]</p>
        <p>Queries all client profiles and displays listing by Traveler (family/contact)</p>
        <p class="p_3">Examples:</p>
        <p>CBP*ABLE/KEN (displays one line per family/contacts whose last name starts with Able and first name starts with Ken)</p>
        <p>CBP*ABLE (displays one line per traveler/contact whose last name starts with Able)</p>
        <p>Traveler information from query results for each matching profile appears in following order:</p>
        <p class="p_4">Profile Type, Traveler Last Name, Traveler First Name, Profile Name, Address 1, City, State, Primary Phone, Primary Email</p>
        <h4>PNR Commands</h4>
        <p><span>CB*[Line#][Enter] </span>- If an agent wants to display all PNR data (including all Optional entries) for one of the profiles included in the current query results, by launching the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Merge to PNR selection screen window, use the command CB*[Line#][Enter]. This launches the window for the Merge to PNR selection screen for the line number chosen from the results.</p>
        <p><span>Example:</span> CB*3 (Launches the window for the Merge to PNR selection screen for Line #3 of the query results.)</p>
        <p>If Traveler/Contact Name is included in the selected line item then that traveler is defaulted to the top of the selection screen with name checked (other travelers are included as well but default to unchecked). User then selects any other Optional entries and uses this screen to click Send to PNR.</p>
        <p><span>CBNM[Line#][Enter]</span> - If an agent wants to automatically move all Always Move Entries for one of the profiles included in the current query results into the current PNR, enter CBNM[Line#][Enter]. This automatically moves all Always Move Entries in the PNR without displaying the selection screen. If Traveler Name is included in the selected line item, the traveler is defaulted along with all of the always move items.</p>
        <p><span>Example:</span> CBNM3 (Automatically moves data from profile results included in line 3 of the query results.)</p>
        <p><span>CBN*[ProfileName]-[TravelerLast/travelerFirst][End]NM </span>- If an agent wants to move a specific traveler from a profile, use this command. If there is no profile/traveler found, agent is prompted, "No Profile to move." If there are multiple profile/travelers found, the first one on the list is moved.</p>
        <p><span>Example:</span> CBN*ABLE/KENNETH-ABLE/JOHN§NM (Automatically moves data for traveler John Able who is a part of Kenneth Able's profile.)</p>
        <p class="p_3">Additional Commands</p>
        <p><span>CBMD </span>- When query results are displayed, five results are listed at a time. To display more results enter the command CBMD to move down.</p>
        <p><span>CBMU</span> - When viewing query results, to move up to a previous set of results, enter the CBMU command.</p>
        <p><span>CBHELP</span> - Displays the list of all <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> command formats.</p>
