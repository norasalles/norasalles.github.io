        <p>To use Live Connect to purchase trip insurance with Squaremouth Travel Insurance, you must obtain a Travel Partner Number to sell Squaremouth Travel Insurance. If not currently licensed to sell Squaremouth Travel Insurance, contact Squaremouth Travel Insurance directly at 800-240-0369 or sign up on their website at <span class="span_2">http://www.squaremouth.com/travel-partner-signup.php</span>.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Set Up Squaremouth Travel Insurance</h3>
        <p>Once you obtain your Affiliate Number, take the following steps to setup <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span> for Live Connect:</p>
        <p><span>Step 1) </span>Create a new or check that a Live Connect Provider for Squaremouth Travel Insurance exists by going to <span>Utilities|Live Connect Providers</span>, and clicking <span class="span_3">Add</span>. (Make sure the URL is correct if Provider is present.)</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Provider Name: </span>Enter Squaremouth Travel Insurance.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>URL: </span>Enter <span>https://www.squaremouth.com/travel-insurance/</span></p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Travel Category: </span>Select Insurance from the drop-down.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Import XML from: </span>Select <span class="span_3">HTML Source.</span></p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Setup for Live Connect agent logins can be done individually. When Live Connect is launched, the system first looks to see if there is login information at the User Login level, and if not, then asks the user to login at the provider website.  Users can set up their own logins by going to <span>Utilities|My Login|Live Connect </span>and clicking <span class="span_3">Add. </span></p>
        <p class="p_3"><span>Live Connect Provider:</span> Select Squaremouth Travel Insurance from the drop-down list.</p>
        <p class="p_3"><span>User Name, Password and Account Number:</span> Leave User Name &amp; Password blank. In <span class="span_3">Account Number, </span>enter your <span class="span_3">Affiliate Number </span>you obtained from Squaremouth Travel Insurance.</p>
        <p><span>Step 3)</span> Create a vendor profile for Squaremouth Travel Insurance. From the General Info tab, click <span class="span_3">Live Connect Providers</span>. From here, click <span class="span_3">Add</span>, then select the desired booking engine (Squaremouth Travel Insurance) from the drop-down list. The vendor code is left blank. </p>
        <p><span>Step 4)</span> Set up insurance prompting by going to <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Insurance Prompting</span>. (See chapter, <span class="span_3">Setting Up ClientBase for Your Agency</span>.) </p>

        <p><span>Step 1)</span> When ready to book on-line, create a client's Res Card and fill in the <span class="span_3">Agent, Status, Reservation Cycle, and Trip Name</span> fields and select the travelers. Click the reservation tab and <span class="span_3">Add</span>. Fill in the Vendor and Travel Category, and click <span class="span_3">Live Connect</span> and <span class="span_3">Create New Reservations:</span></p>

        </p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Select any customer information for use to book the Squaremouth Travel Insurance reservation. This data is automatically passed to Squaremouth Travel Insurance and saves time during the booking process, as less fields need to be completed manually.

        </p>
        <p><span>Step 4)</span> The system prompts with the reservation records included in this Res Card. Highlight each reservation to insure. To highlight and select multiple reservations, use the CTRL key in combination with clicking. Again, this step is designed to save time during the insurance booking process, as less fields need to be completed manually. Any missing or incomplete data can be updated on the Squaremouth Travel Insurance website confirming the insurance booking. Click <span class="span_3">Connect</span>. </p>

        </p>
        <p><span>Step 5)</span> Although still in <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>, you are on-line at the booking site. Complete the reservations and when the reservation is confirmed, click <span class="span_3">Import Reservation</span> on right-hand upper corner, and all reservation data booked on-line is now located in the reservation in <span class="span_3">ClientBase</span>. </p>
