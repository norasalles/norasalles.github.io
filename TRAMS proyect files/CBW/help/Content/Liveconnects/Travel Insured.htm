        <p>To use Live Connect to purchase insurance with Travel Insured, you must be registered to sell Travel Insured insurance. If not currently licensed to sell Travel Insured, or have not been setup to book on-line, contact Travel Insured directly by e-mailing <a href="mailto:info@travelinsured.com"><span class="Hyperlink">info@travelinsured.com</span></a> .</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Set Up Travel Insured</h3>
        <p>Upon receiving login information from Travel Insured, take the following steps to setup <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> for Live Connect.</p>
        <p><span>Step 1) </span>Create a new or check that a Live Connect Provider for Travel Insured exists by going to <span>Utilities|Live Connect Providers</span>, and clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. (Make sure the URL is correct if Provider is present.)</p>
        <p><span>Provider Name: </span>Enter Travel Insured.</p>
        <p><span>URL:</span> <span>https://www.travelinsured.com/</span><span class="span_2">trams</span><span>login.aspx</span></p>
        <p><span>Travel Category: </span>Select Insurance from the drop-down.</p>
        <p><span>Import XML from: </span>Select <span class="span_2">HTML Source.</span></p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Setup for Live Connect agent logins can be done individually. When Live Connect is launched, the system first looks to see if there is login information at the User Login level, and if not, then asks the user to login at the provider website.  Users can set up their own logins by going to <span>Utilities|My Login|Live Connect </span>and clicking <span class="span_2">Add. </span></p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Live Connect Provider:</span> Select Travel Insured from the drop-down list.*</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>User Login: </span>Enter the Login ID supplied upon registration.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>User Password: </span>Enter the password supplied upon registration. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Account Number: </span>Leave blank. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Agency Code:</span> Leave blank. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to save.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Note: </span><span class="span_2">You are also given a Username and Agency number. These are not used here.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>Step 3) </span>From the profile manager, retrieve the Travel Insured vendor profile (or create if it is not in database). From the General Info tab, click <span class="span_2">Live Connect Providers</span>. From here, click <span class="span_2">Add</span>, then select Travel Insured from the drop-down list. The vendor code is left blank. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Travel Insured Features</h3>
        <p>Travel Insured supports the following Live Connect features if checked:<img src="../Resources/Images/Travel Insured/Travel Insured Features.jpg" style="height: 328px;width: 546px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/fourth.30.1.01.jpg" class="img_1" /></p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Create New Travel Insured Reservation </h3>
        <p><span>Step 1) </span>Click <span class="span_2">Reservation</span> tab and <span class="span_2">Add </span>in the Res Card. Select Travel Insured as the vendor and click <span class="span_2">Live Connect.</span> </p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Select Travel Insured from the drop-down menu by <span class="span_2">Connect To</span> and then click <span class="span_2">Create New Reservations</span>.</p>
        <p><span>Step 3)</span> Select any customer information to use to book the Travel Insured reservation. This data is automatically passed to Travel Insured and saves time during the booking process, as less fields need to be completed manually. Click <span class="span_2">Connect</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Travel Insured/Travel Insured Features_1.jpg" style="height: 366px;width: 519px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/fourth.30.1.02.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p><span>Step 4) </span>The system prompts with the reservation records included in this Res Card. Highlight each reservation to insure. To highlight and select multiple reservations to insure, use the CTRL key in combination with clicking, and the system completes the summary trip information. Again, this step is designed to save time during the insurance booking process. Any missing or incomplete data can be updated on the Travel Insured website confirming the insurance booking. Click <span class="span_2">Connect.</span></p>

        </p>
        <p><span>Step 5)</span> Although in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, you are now on-line at the booking site. Complete the reservations and when the reservation is confirmed, click <span class="span_2">Import Reservation</span>. All reservation data booked on-line is now located in the reservation fields in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
