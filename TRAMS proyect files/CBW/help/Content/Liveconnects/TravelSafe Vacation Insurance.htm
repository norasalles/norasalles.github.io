        <p>To use Live Connect to purchase TravelSafe Vacation Insurance, you must be an authorized TravelSafe representative with a current User ID (Travel Agency Code). If currently authorized, use your User ID to sell TravelSafe through <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. The User ID is pre-printed on your current TravelSafe brochures/certificates. You also need a password and account number. Please call the TravelSafe office to receive this information. If not licensed or authorized to sell TravelSafe Vacation Insurance, please contact TravelSafe directly at 1-800-523-8020 to provide you with the necessary forms. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Set Up TravelSafe Vacation Insurance</h3>
        <p>Upon receiving a User ID and password for each agent in your office, take the following steps to setup <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> for Live Connect.</p>
        <p><span>Step 1) </span>Create a new or check that a Live Connect Provider for TravelSafe Vacation Insurance exists by going to <span>Utilities|Live Connect Providers</span>, and clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. (Make sure the URL is correct if Provider is present.)</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Provider Name: </span>Enter TravelSafe Vacation Insurance.</p>
        <p><span>URL:</span> Enter <span>https://agent.travelsafe.com/affiliates/tramspost</span></p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Travel Category: </span>Select Insurance from the drop-down.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Import XML from: </span>Select <span class="span_2">HTML Source.</span></p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Setup for Live Connect agent logins can be done individually. When Live Connect is launched, the system first looks to see if there is login information at the User Login level, and if not, then asks the user to login at the provider website.  Users can set up their own logins by going to <span>Utilities|My Login|Live Connect </span>and clicking <span class="span_2">Add. </span></p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>User Name:</span> Enter the TravelSafe ID Code.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Password:</span> Enter the TravelSafe password here.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Account Number:</span> Enter the agency code obtained from TravelSafe here. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Agency Code: </span>Leave blank. Click <span class="span_2">OK.</span></p>
        <p><span>Step 3) </span>From the Profile Manager, retrieve the TravelSafe Vendor Profile (or create if it is not in database). From the General Info tab click <span class="span_2">Live Connect Providers</span>. From here, click <span class="span_2">Add</span>, then select TravelSafe from the drop-down list. The vendor code is left blank. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">TravelSafe Features</h3>
        <p>TravelSafe supports the following Live Connect features if checked:<img src="../Resources/Images/TravelSafe Vacation Insurance/TravelSafe Features.jpg" style="height: 323px;width: 539px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/fourth.30.1.04.jpg" class="img_1" /></p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Create New TravelSafe Reservation </h3>
        <p><span>Step 1) </span>Click <span class="span_2">Reservation</span> Tab and <span class="span_2">Add </span>in the Res Card. Select TravelSafe as the vendor and click <span class="span_2">Live Connect.</span> </p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Select TravelSafe from the drop-down menu by <span class="span_2">Connect To</span> and then click <span class="span_2">Create New Reservations</span>.</p>
        <p><span>Step 3)</span> Select any customer information to use to book the TravelSafe reservation. This data is automatically passed to TravelSafe and saves time during the booking process, as less fields need to be completed manually. Click <span class="span_2">Connect</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/TravelSafe Vacation Insurance/TravelSafe Features_1.jpg" style="height: 366px;width: 519px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/fourth.30.1.05.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p><span>Step 4) </span>The system prompts with the reservation records included in this Res Card. Highlight each reservation to insure. To highlight and select multiple reservations to insure, use the CTRL key in combination with clicking, and the system completes the summary trip information. Again, this step is designed to save time during the insurance booking process. Any missing or incomplete data can be updated on the TravelSafe website confirming the insurance booking. Click <span class="span_2">Connect.</span></p>
        <p><span>Step 5) </span>Although still in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, you are now on-line at the booking site. Complete the reservations and when the reservation is confirmed, click <span class="span_2">Import Reservation</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/TravelSafe Vacation Insurance/TravelSafe Features.png" style="height: 281px;width: 500px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>All reservation data booked on-line is now located in the reservation fields in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
