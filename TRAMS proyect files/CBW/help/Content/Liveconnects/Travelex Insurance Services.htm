        <p>If already licensed to sell Travelex Insurance Services, use the Travelex location number as the account number when using Live Connect. If not currently licensed to sell Travelex, call Travelex Sales Support at 1-800-537-8052.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Set Up Travelex Insurance Services</h3>
        <p>Once you have a Travelex location number, take the following steps to setup <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> for Live Connect:</p>
        <p><span>Step 1) </span>Create a new or check that a Live Connect Provider for Travelex Insurance Services exists by going to <span>Utilities|Live Connect Providers</span>, and clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. (Make sure the URL is correct if Provider is present.)</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Provider Name: </span>Enter Travelex Insurance.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>URL: </span><span>https://www.travelexinsurance.com/EntryPoint</span><span class="span_2">Trams</span><span>.aspx</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Travel Category: </span>Select Insurance from the drop-down.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Import XML from: </span>Select <span class="span_2">HTML Source.</span></p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Setup for Live Connect agent logins can be done individually. When Live Connect is launched, the system first looks to see if there is login information at the User Login level, and if not, then asks the user to login at the provider website.  Users can set up their own logins by going to <span>Utilities|My Login|Live Connect </span>and clicking <span class="span_2">Add. </span></p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Live Connect Provider: </span>Select the appropriate Travelex Live Connect Provider to connect to its booking engine. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>User Name:</span> Enter User Name.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Password: </span>No password is needed.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Account Number: </span>Enter the Travelex location number issued at the time of registration as the account number. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to save.</p>
        <p>Complete the following fields (the other fields are grayed out as they are not applicable):</p>
        <p><span>Step 3) </span>Create a vendor profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> for Travelex Insurance Services. From the Profile Manager, retrieve the Travelex vendor profile (or create one). From the General Info Tab, click <span class="span_2">Live Connect Providers</span>. From here, click <span class="span_2">Add</span>, then select the desired booking engine (Travelex) from the drop-down list. <span>The vendor code is </span><span>TVX</span><span>.</span> Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Travelex Insurance Services Features</h3>
        <p>Travelex Insurance Services supports the following Live Connect Features if checked:<img src="../Resources/Images/Travelex Insurance Services/Travelex Insurance Services_1.jpg" style="height: 332px;width: 540px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/third1ab.28.1.28.jpg" class="img_1" /></p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Create New Travelex Insurance Services Reservation</h3>
        <p><span>Step 1) </span>Enter the Res Card information needed and click the <span class="span_2">Reservation</span> Tab and <span class="span_2">Add </span>in the Res Card. Fill in the <span class="span_2">Travel Category</span> and <span class="span_2">Vendor</span> fields and then click <span class="span_2">Live Connect</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Travelex Insurance Services/Travelex Insurance Services_1_1.jpg" style="height: 134px;width: 560px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/third1ab.28.1.29.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Select Travelex from the drop-down menu by <span class="span_2">Connect To</span> (if not defaulted), and then click <span class="span_2">Create New Reservations</span>.</p>
        <p><span>Step 3)</span> Select any customer information for use to book the Travelex reservation. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Travelex Insurance Services/Travelex Insurance Services_1_2.jpg" style="height: 366px;width: 519px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/third1ab.28.1.30.jpg" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>This data is automatically passed to Travelex and saves time during the booking process, as less fields need to be completed manually. Click <span class="span_2">Connect.</span></p>
        <p><span>Step 4) </span>The system prompts with the reservation records included in this Res Card. Highlight each reservation to insure. To highlight and select multiple reservations to insure, use the CTRL key in combination with clicking, and the system completes the summary trip information. Again, this step is designed to save time during the insurance booking process. Any missing or incomplete data can be updated on the Travelex website confirming the insurance booking. Click <span class="span_2">Connect.</span></p>
        <p class="p_4">

        </p>
        <p><span>Step 5) </span>Although still in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, you are now on-line at the booking site. Complete the reservations and when the reservation is confirmed, click <span class="span_2">Import Reservation</span>.</p>
        <p>
