        <p>If you are already licensed to sell iTravelInsured, your user name is the iTravelInsured Account number, and the password is <span class="span_2">Trams</span> (lower case). If not currently licensed to sell iTravelInsured, contact iTravelInsured directly at 866-347-6673 or go to <a href="http://www.itravelinsured.net"><span class="Hyperlink">http://www.itravelinsured.net</span></a> and click <span class="span_2">Registration Form</span>. The form is a pdf/adobe file format. Print the registration form, complete it and send it to iTravelInsured. Within 24 hours, iTravelInsured will contact you with a user name and password.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Set Up iTravelInsured</h3>
        <p>Upon receiving a user name and password for each agent in your office, take the following steps to setup <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> for Live Connect.</p>
        <p><span>Step 1)</span> Create a Live Connect Provider for iTravelInsured if none exists by going to <span>Utilities|Live Connect Providers</span>, and clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. (It’s a good idea to check if the URL is correct.) </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Provider Name: </span>Enter iTravelInsured.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>URL: </span>Enter <span>https://www.itravelinsured.com/</span><span class="span_2">Trams</span></p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Travel Category: </span>Enter Insurance from the drop-down menu.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Import XML from: </span>Enter HTML Source.</p>
        <p><span>Step 2)</span> Setup for Live Connect agent logins can be done individually. When Live Connect is launched, the system first looks to see if there is login information at the User Login level, and if not, then asks the user to login at the provider website.  Users can set up their own logins by going to <span>Utilities|My Login|Live Connect </span>and clicking <span class="span_2">Add. </span></p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Live Connect Provider:</span> Select iTravelInsured from the drop-down menu to connect to its booking engine. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>User Name:</span> Enter the user name provided to you when registering with iTravelInsured. If already licensed to sell iTravelInsured, the user name is the iTravelInsured Account number. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Password:</span> Enter the password provided to you when registering with iTravelInsured. If already licensed to sell iTravelInsured, the password is <span class="span_2">Trams</span> (lower case)<span class="span_2">. </span>All other fields are left blank. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to save.</p>
        <p><span>Step 3) </span>Next, setup an iTravelInsured vendor profile. From the profile manager, retrieve the vendor profile for iTravelInsured (or create the vendor profile) and from the General Info tab, click <span class="span_2">Live Connect Providers</span>. From here, click <span class="span_2">Add</span>, then select the iTravelInsured booking engine from the drop-down list. The vendor code is left blank. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. </p>

        </p>
        <p><span>Step 4) </span>The system prompts with the reservation records included in this Res Card. Highlight any reservation to insure.
