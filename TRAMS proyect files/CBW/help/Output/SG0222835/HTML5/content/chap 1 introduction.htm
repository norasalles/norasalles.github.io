            <h1><a name="Introduction_..125" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor94"></a>Introduction</h1>
            <p class="p_2">This introduction provides a general overview of ClientBase, how it fits into agency operations, what it is, what it can do for your agency and front-line agents, and how to get started using the program.</p>
            <h2><a name="How_Does_ClientBase_Fit_In_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>How Does ClientBase Fit In?</h2>
            <p>Look around your desk. What do you see? Pictures of family, a phone, a calendar from one of the cruise lines, facial tissue. But wait! What’s that behind all those Post-it notes? It’s a computer! In most cases, it was put there as a terminal for a Global Distribution System (GDS), i.e. SABRE, Apollo/Galileo, Amadeus or Worldspan. If you are like many agents, you use it to book travel for clients and to find information on airfares, seats, hotel rooms, car rentals, etc. You may even use it to handle e-mail and browse the web, but not much more.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h2><a name="My_Computer_Can_Do_More_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>My Computer Can Do More?</h2>
            <p>That brings us to the point we want to make. The computer is a powerful tool that may not be being used to its full potential. That’s where software comes in. Software programs are the different “hats” that your computer can wear to help you do things.</p>
            <p>ClientBase turns your computer into a marketing machine. Other software programs allow you to design illustrations, navigate the internet, manage your accounting information, write books or even print information on worldwide destinations. The list of things that software programs can do continues to grow and grow. Many of them can be running along with your GDS simultaneously, and with a simple click of the mouse on your task bar, you can move among them. All of this can be a great benefit to you at work, but it starts with you being open to a new way of working and to new tools that may help you do your job better -- even make your job easier.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h2><a name="What_is_ClientBase_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>What is ClientBase?</h2>
            <p><span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> is a tool for selling travel. It’s an easy-to-use marketing database system developed specifically for travel agents. The program gives you flexibility in maintaining the marketing and travel demographic components of your clientele. Not just another software program, <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> represents an evolving solution to your customer relationship management (CRM) needs.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h2><a name="It’s_About_Building_and_Maintaining_Relationships" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>It’s About Building and Maintaining Relationships</h2>
            <p><span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> organizes all the client information you decide is relevant for marketing, and gives you an easy way to access that information quickly. From the outside, <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> is a powerful tool designed to help you sell travel to people. Inside, you will find key features that assist you in building and maintaining lasting relationships with your clients.</p>
            <p>You know how important it is to maintain a good relationship with your clients, especially if you are a travel professional specializing in leisure travel. You succeed by creating a bond, building trust and by matching the right travel products and services with your customers. However, keeping track of the increasing quantity of leisure travelers and complexity of travel packages is a difficult task. You need an easy-to-use tool that allows you to access the pertinent information you have stored for every client. </p>
            <p><span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> is that tool. Install it and see for yourself!</p>
