            <p class="p_2">This chapter demonstrates how to use the Activity Manager to manage key customer contacts and organize agent activities. </p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..77" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Agent productivity is a requirement for agency success. To be productive, an agent must manage relationships with agency customers, record key contacts with customers, follow up on leads, and administer agent tasks and to-do lists. Wow, that sounds like a lot for an agent to do! </p>
            <p>Fortunately, the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Activity Manager provides tools to achieve these goals in the form of <span>Notes</span>, <span>Reminders</span> and <span>Mailers.</span> Agents learn how to use these powerful tools to develop habits which ensure their own increased productivity. An agent who is well-organized and productive is likely to have a following of happy customers. Your agency’s marketing and management team benefit as well.</p>
            <h2><a name="Querying_Activities" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor48"></a>Querying Activities</h2>
            <p>After agents begin using Notes, Reminders and Mailers (as detailed in chapter, <span>An In-Depth Look at Activities</span>) to document vital customer contacts, they start each work day by signing into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and clicking the <span class="span_2">Activities Manager</span> tab. By default, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> queries the database for the user login’s open reminders and the results screen immediately displays a list of the reminders (or tasks) the agent needs to complete each day.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using the activity manager/using the activity manager.jpg" style="height: 372px;width: 575px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Act%20Mgr%20to%20Mangage%20Your%20Activities.15.1.01.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>At the top of the results screen, notice tabs marked Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. An agent uses the Level 1, 2 and 3 Query filters to access customized activity (contact) queries. These queries can be quite valuable as productivity and management tools. </p>
            <h3><a name="Level_1_Activity_Manager_Query" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor49"></a>Level 1 Activity Manager Query</h3>
            <p class="p_4">

            </p>
            <p>The Level 1 Activity Manager Query contains four fields which are strung together with an “and”. (Another way of saying this is that <span>All</span> fields are evaluated to form the results of the query.) After setting up the selection criteria, and clicking <span class="span_2">Refresh</span>, the Query results appear in the results screen. </p>
            <p><span>Login Name: </span>Defaults to the sign-in user. Choose a different user by clicking the drop-down menu. This is useful if an agent is absent, and you want to check his to-do list for high priority items.</p>
            <p><span>Select:</span> Defaults to <span class="span_2">Open Reminders Only</span>. Choose a different entry by clicking the drop-down menu. Choose <span class="span_2">Open Reminders Only, Open Reminders With Alarms, Closed Reminders Only, All Reminders, Mailers w/o Responses, Mailers With Responses, All Mailers, All Notes, Reminders, </span>and <span class="span_2">Mailers</span>.</p>
            <p><span>From Date: </span>To select a specific date range for the Query, enter the from date here; or click the drop-down menu and double-click a date from the calendar. </p>
            <p><span>To Date:</span> To select a specific date range for the Query, enter the from date here; or click the drop-down menu and double-click date from calendar.</p>
            <p><span>Refresh:</span> After setting up the Level 1 Query, click <span class="span_2">Refresh</span> to run the Query.</p>
            <h4><a name="querying_trams_back_office_reminders" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor50"></a>querying trams back office reminders</h4>
            <p>ClientBase activity queries now display Trams Back Office-created reminders even if they are not linked to a profile (Trams Back Office users have the ability to create reminders that are not linked to a specific profile type). Because ClientBase Level 1 queries only include Active Profiles, Trams Back Office activities that are not linked to any profile will not be shown in results. Users must use a Level 2 query with Profile Status = Blank or a Level 3 query with Filter Type Blank on the Profile tab.&#160; Trams Back Office-created Activities are presented on Activity Reports, even if not linked to a Profile. </p>
            <h3><a name="Level_2_Activity_Manager_Query" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor51"></a>Level 2 Activity Manager Query</h3>
            <p>The Level 2 Query area of the Activity Manager provides the ability to Query the database of Notes, Reminders and Mailers by virtually any field captured in these records, and includes the ability to Query by a particular client as well. Track the type of marketing tasks scheduled, when and if they have been completed, which agents are completing them, the mailings that are being sent and the response to those mailings. The options are endless. </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>By clicking the <span class="span_2">Level 2 Tab</span> in the Activity Manager, and then, <span class="span_2">Filter</span>, under the <span class="span_2">Activity Tab, </span>enter selection criteria into the following screen. Since Level 2 Query “remembers” the last Query run, click <span class="span_2">Reset</span> to clear. Like Level 1 Query, the fields are strung together with “ands” across the fields, but within the field you can use “or” to narrow down the search even further. After setting up the criteria for Activities, click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to activate the specialized list.</p>
            <h4><a name="ACTIVITY_TAB" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>ACTIVITY TAB</h4>
            <p><span>Reminders/Mailers/Notes:</span> Check which type of activity to include in the Level 2 Query.</p>
            <p><span>Completed/Responded:</span> When you have checked the activity type, a drop-down menu appears from which to qualify the activity: <span class="span_2">All, Completed/Responded/, or Not Completed/Not Responded.</span></p>
            <p><span>Activity Date - From/To/To-Do (Timeless):</span> Choose a range for the activity date, or if you prefer, choose the timeless to-do’s.</p>
            <p><span>Duration:</span> Choose the activities by duration by clicking the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span>Login Name:</span> The login name defaults to the sign-in agent, or choose from the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span>Priority:</span> Choose the priority type from the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span>Private:</span> Choose those activities which were marked private.</p>

            <p>Use general profile data as filters when running a Level 2 Query in the Activity Manager. Query by profile to locate activities and print results, as well as enhance your ability to Query lists of activities. </p>
            <h3><a name="Level_3_Activity_Manager_Query" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor52"></a>Level 3 Activity Manager Query</h3>
            <p>The Query Level 3 provides users with an even greater ability to more narrowly define a search. As detailed above, Level 2 Query allows a search by any number of fields, stringing one statement of criteria together with an "and." Query Level 3 strings multiple statements of criteria together with an "or," using search method options to define how the criteria should filter. The Level 3 Query has a totally different look from Level 2 Query:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using the activity manager/chapter 11 using the activity manager_535x147.png" style="width: 535;height: 147;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>There are a set of buttons including <span class="span_2">Add Filter, </span><span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter, </span><span class="span_2">Modify Filter, Delete Filter, Reset All</span> (to clear out all filters currently displayed), and <span class="span_2">Summarize</span>. <span>Notice there </span><span>will be </span><span>nothing to view in the results screen</span><span> until </span><span>set</span><span>up the criteria statement(s) and click </span><span class="span_2">Refresh</span><span> to see the Level 3 Query results. </span></p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>It is not necessary to completely re-enter the criteria when adding similar filters. Once the first filter has been added to a Level 3 query, the <span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter</span> button is enabled. When clicked, a Level 3 query screen is opened, pre-populated with all of the criteria from the selected filter. Users can also right-click on a filter and select <span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter</span>.</p>
            <p>To enter the search criteria into Level 3 Query after clicking <span class="span_2">Reset All</span>, click Add Filter: </p>

            </p>
            <p>Activities folder tabs, <span class="span_2">Activities </span>and <span class="span_2">General Info appear.</span> What is unique about the Level 3 Query is that most of the available search fields are divided into two parts. Directly to the left of the field, is a box with a drop-down menu of search method options called, Operators, with which you can narrow down your search. Sample Operators include: <span class="span_2">Is Equal to; Less than or Equal to; Greater than or Equal to; Less than, Greater than, Not Equal to; Starts With; Contains; Is BLANK; </span><span>and</span><span class="span_2"> Is NOT BLANK.</span> Search fields are strung together with an <span class="span_2">And. </span>Use both tabs to setup the first filter or your query, and click <span class="span_2">OK. </span>Click <span class="span_2">Refresh</span> to see the results of your first filter. </p>
            <p>To set up a second filter, click <span class="span_2">Add. </span>Remember as you are setting up subsequent filters, there is an OR between all the filters you are stringing together. </p>
            <h3><a name="Using_Date_Formulas_in_Queries_..79" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor53"></a>Using Date Formulas in Queries</h3>
            <p>Since queries can be saved and retrieved for frequent use, the date fields in all queries allow for date formulas. This means any field that has a date, can also contain a formula for that date. The date formula function allows you to create a query without identifying a specific month, day and year in the <span class="span_2">From</span> and <span class="span_2">To</span> date fields. Instead, the query is processed with a formula for the month, day, day of the week, and year based upon the date the report is processed. </p>
            <p><span>Remember: </span>Make sure the system date and time are correct.</p>
            <p><span>Benefit</span>: When entering a date formula, your system converts it to the intended time period allowing you to run queries and/or save them for future use without the need to modify dates.</p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> The following tables contain sample formulas for specifying dates. Mix and match the absolute and relative parameters in the function. The first number specifies the day of the month, the second number specifies the month, and the third number specifies the year. So if you only have the first number filled in, this means you want this report to reoccur on this day every month, in every year.</p>
            <p class="p_5">DATE FORMULAS:</p>

            <h2><a name="Save_Queries_for_Easy_Access" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Save Queries for Easy Access</h2>
            <p>As you can see, queries run in the Activity Manager can become quite complex. With all the available filters in Level 1, 2, and Level 3 Queries, you can view any list of marketing activities performed (or not) within the agency. With this in mind, if there are certain queries that to run often, we suggest you save the query filters after setting them up. This is called saving a query to a folder. That way, the next time you run a saved query, all you do is click the saved folder. One click and your query filters are completed automatically. </p>
            <p>Here are some steps for saving a query:</p>
            <p>1) Using Level 1 and Level 2 filters in the Activity Manager, run your query (use date formulas, if applicable).</p>
            <p>2) To customize the columns used in the query, click <span class="span_2">Columns</span> on the Activity Manager results screen.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using the activity manager/to enter the search criteria_1.jpg" style="height: 360px;width: 481px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Act%20Mgr%20to%20Mangage%20Your%20Activities.15.1.06.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>If you would like to change a column, move the highlighted column over to the other side by using the<span> &gt;</span> or <span>&lt; </span>arrow. By using the shift key and mouse, select as many consecutive entries as you want to move and use the <span>&gt;&gt;</span> or <span>&lt;&lt; </span>arrows. By using the control key and your mouse, select non-consecutive entries to move. Use the up and down arrows to order the selections. To sort up to 3 columns in ascending or descending order, click <span class="span_2">Sort by Columns. </span></p>
            <p>Arrange and size the columns in the query by inserting your mouse between the column headers (see a bi-directional arrow), hold down the left mouse button, and pull the columns to the new size. </p>
            <p>To move a column to a different location, hold the mouse over the column in the column header you want to move (see a vertical line extending down). Press the left mouse button and pull the column left or right to its new location. To "quick" sort results, hold down the shift key and click the column header to sort by. A triangle in the up position appears within the header signifies ascending order, while a triangle in the down position signifies descending order.</p>
            <p>3) When satisfied with the query results, click <span>File|Save Query As</span>. The following screen appears:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using the activity manager/to enter the search criteria_2.jpg" style="height: 221px;width: 341px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Act%20Mgr%20to%20Mangage%20Your%20Activities.15.1.07.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>4) From the drop-down <span class="span_2">Level</span> menu, choose whether to save Query as <span class="span_2">Personal</span> (for your own use only), or as <span class="span_2">Global</span> (for the use of everyone in the agency).</p>
            <p>5) Name the query.</p>
            <p>6) Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. See the new query located on the left hand side of the Activity Manager screen. </p>
            <p><span>Note:</span><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> saves the filters and results layout you have selected, <span>not</span> the query results. The next time you use the saved query, any new data that has been added since it was created, is included in the new query. </p>
            <h2><a name="Working_with_Query_Results_..80" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Working with Query Results </h2>
            <p>As mentioned previously, at the beginning of each day agents click the Activity Manager to access their to-do lists. By default, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> queries the database for the login user’s open reminders and the results screen immediately displays an organized list of the reminders (or tasks) that the agent needs to complete that day. </p>
            <p>An agent can view the originally formatted reminder and its details by double-clicking the highlighted reminder. Once inside the reminder, the agent can hot-key to the attached profile by clicking <span class="span_2">GoTo Profile</span> icon at the top of the reminder screen, or beside the <span class="span_2">Profile</span> field. The agent can also hotkey into the Res Card if desired.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using the activity manager/working with query results.jpg" style="height: 281px;width: 430px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Act%20Mgr%20to%20Mangage%20Your%20Activities.15.1.08.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Toggling from each task in the reminder list to the profile and back is simple and quick. From the profile, access marketing, traveler or other key data that adds the personal touch necessary for effective relationship-building. Click the activities tab of the profile to refresh your memory on previous contacts you've had with the client. Print out the reminder by clicking the printer icon in the toolbar. </p>
            <p>Click in the <span class="span_2">Completed</span> box located within the reminder record to indicate when a reminder has been completed. This brings up a date field in which you can input a date or use the down-arrow key to access a handy calendar. This removes it from your to-do list (after clicking <span class="span_2">Refresh</span>), but leaves the completed record for history within the profile’s activity tab.</p>
            <p>Once you've developed the habit of following up on travel inquires, begin using reminders to organize other marketing and administrative tasks, such as payment deadlines, checking for documents, welcome home calls, etc. Reminders can also be used to jog your memory of personal obligations such as dentist appointments, picking up dry cleaning, etc. Since all reminders need to be attached to some type of profile, use your agent profile to create these type of personal reminders.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Retrieve the profiles of your most loyal customers and schedule at least 4 occasions each year to reach out and touch them. Remind them often of how valuable they are. Use things like birthdays, anniversaries, annual vacation times and holidays as a reason to communicate with customers. Every time you put your agency in front of customers, you re-enforce relationships, reminding them <span class="span_4">you</span> are their travel professional.</p>

            <p>To multi-select records from the results of a Query, use the CTRL key in combination with a mouse click. Notice one of three symbols next to each profile: </p>
            <p>a) <span>Bullet</span> - Signifies this profile has been selected.</p>
            <p>b) <span>Bullet and Bracket</span> - Signifies this profile has been selected and is the current profile record the cursor is focused on. </p>
            <p>c) <span>Solid Triangle</span> - Signifies this profile has NOT been selected as part of the multi-select, but is the current record the cursor is focused on. CTRL and click once to get the Bullet and Bracket, and a second time to NOT include in the multi-select. </p>
            <p>Also use the edit menu or right-mouse click the results screen to <span class="span_2">Select</span><span class="span_2">All</span>, <span class="span_2">Unselect All</span> or<span class="span_2"> Inverse</span> the selection.

            <p>From the results of a query generated from the Activity Manager, the database administrator can globally modify any of the fields within those results by going to <span>Utilities|Global Modify</span>. Now, if an Agent leaves your agency and you want to reassign all open reminders to another agent, Global Modify them all rather than changing one by one. Or, if you have a group of Reminders that you just completed and want to mark closed, Global Modify them rather than closing one by one.</p>
            <p><span>Important Note:</span> Using any of the Global Modify features should be done with extreme care. Massive changes to your database can be accomplished with a single click. If you are in any way unsure of the expected results of running Global Modify, be sure to backup your database using the <span class="span_2">Trams</span> IBBackup utility just before running it.</p>
            <p><span>1)</span> After using the Level 1, 2 or Level 3 Query to locate the Activities to Global Modify go to <span>Utilities|Global Modify</span>. You have two different global modify features to choose from.</p>
            <p><span>Set Value</span> - This feature allows you to designate what type of Activity within your results to modify, Notes, Reminders or Mailers (you can only globally modify one type of activity at a time), along with the ability to select which field within that type of record you would like to modify. A listing of the fields within that type of activity appear for you to set a common value. Once these settings are complete, you have the ability to identify which records in the Activity Manager to modify based on either all current results, only selected results or a range of results.</p>
            <p><span>Convert Type</span> - This feature allows you to turn Notes into Reminders or Mailers, Mailers into Notes or Reminders, and Reminders into Notes or Mailers. First designate what type of Activity within your results to convert, Notes, Reminders or Mailers (you can only globally modify one type of activity at a time). Then select what type you would like to convert them to. Once these settings are complete, you have the ability to identify which records in the Activity Manager to modify based on either all current results, only selected results or a range of results.</p>
            <p><span>2)</span> Once all settings are complete click the <span class="span_2">Global Modify Now</span> button and a count appears identifying the number of records modified, skipped and the total. Records skipped are a result of having multiple types of Activities within your current query results.</p>
