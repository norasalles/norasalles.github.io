            <p class="p_2">This chapter familiarizes you with how to setup, maintain and use Agent Profiles.</p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..15" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Why would you want to keep an in-depth profile on each of your agents? Personnel and resource information are two reasons that immediately come to mind. Other examples include emergency contact information, payroll and tax information, and to track expertise. For example, you just had a hot special interest scuba dive special land on your desk. You know you have several customers with an interest in scuba diving, but can’t recall if any of your agents have any expertise with this niche. If you have carefully maintained your agent profiles, you can simply set scuba diving as one of the marketing filters in your Query and run an agent report. Quickly identify just the right agent to lead your group. </p>
            <h2><a name="Anatomy_of_an_Agent_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Anatomy of an Agent Profile</h2>
            <p>Agent profiles in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> store an unlimited amount of information about agent entities. To organize all this information and make it easily accessible, each profile is made up of seven key areas (Toolbar, Header Info, Scrolling Arrows, Control Buttons, Information Tabs, and User-Defined Fields).</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 18 an in-depth look at agent profiles/an in depth look at agent.jpg" style="height: 375px;width: 582px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Agent%20Profiles.37.1.01.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Let us explore each of these seven key areas:</p>
            <h3><a name="Toolbar_..16" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Toolbar</h3>
            <p class="p_3">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 18 an in-depth look at agent profiles/an in depth look at agent_1.jpg" style="height: 65px;width: 432px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Agent%20Profiles.37.1.02.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p><span>Create a Reminder:</span> Click the Remind icon to create a reminder for the agent. An agent reminder might be a personal reminder that appears on her to-do list, such as remembering to attend a CTC meeting. Fill in the date you wish to be reminded, set the priority, reminder type, set an optional alarm and finally type in some free-flowing remarks for reference. There is an option to mark this Reminder “Private” so that only the creation agent or SYSDBA can view it. This reminder appears on queries in the Activity Manager or reports.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Note:</span> Click the Note icon to create a note documenting any contact you have with an agent. By entering the date, time, and subject of the contact, a history of contacts is created that appears in the activity manager or on reports.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Mailer:</span> Click the Mailer icon to create a mailer documenting mailings you have sent to an agent. By entering the date, time, and subject of the mailer, a history of mailers is created that appears in the activity manager or reports.</p>
            <p><span>Print:</span> Click the print icon to print out details of the agent profile.</p>
            <p><span>Merge to Label</span>: Click the label icon to create a label for the agent.</p>
            <p><span>Merge to Document Template:</span> Click the letter icon to merge agent name and address to any letter contained in the document templates. The letter can be customized by the user to add a personalized touch.</p>
            <p><span>Merge to E-mail:</span> Click the e-mail icon to merge agent’s primary e-mail address into an e-mail screen. Complete the e-mail.</p>
            <h3><a name="Header_Information" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Header Information</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 18 an in-depth look at agent profiles/an in depth look at agent_624x72.png" style="width: 624;height: 72;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>The header conveniently displays pertinent information including the current mailing address, the first five communication entries captured for this profile, number of Marketing Codes, Primary Contact, Groups, Profile Create Date, Salutation, Interface ID, and Profile No. </p>
            <p>The header displays the first five Communication entries, in the order they are listed on the profile's Communications tab. If there are not five entries at the profile level, then the primary contact's communications are displayed next, in the order they are listed on the primary contact's communications tab. If there still are not 5 communications to display, then ClientBase picks up from the other contacts listed on the Contacts tab, in the order they are listed there, until all five slots are filled. </p>
            <p>The items in the header are clickable. When clicked, the user is taken to that section of the profile. For example, when the Marketing Codes count is clicked, the Marketing tab opens; when the Primary Contact is clicked, that Contact record opens. </p>
            <h3><a name="Scrolling_Arrows_..17" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Scrolling Arrows</h3>
            <p class="p_4">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 18 an in-depth look at agent profiles/an in depth look at agent_2.jpg" style="height: 104px;width: 58px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Agent%20Profiles.37.1.04.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>The four black arrows provide navigation to move among the profiles included within the current Query in the results screen.</p>
            <h3><a name="Profile_Indicators" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Profile Indicators</h3>
            <p class="p_4">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 18 an in-depth look at agent profiles/an in depth look at agent_3.jpg" style="height: 104px;width: 56px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Agent%20Profiles.37.1.05.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Indicators to the right of the arrows appear if:</p>
            <ul class="ul_1">
                <li class="ListParagraph_1" value="1">There are res cards for this agent</li>
                <li class="ListParagraph_1" value="2">Travel History indicates this agent has invoice history</li>
                <li class="ListParagraph_1" value="3">An open reminder alerts of some future action is scheduled to take place.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ListParagraph">&#160;</p>
            <p>If the Agent has no open Reminders or past Travel History, no icons appear. </p>
            <h3><a name="Control_Buttons" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Control Buttons</h3>
            <p><span class="span_2">Close:</span> Takes you out of the profile and only appears if there are no unsaved changes made to the profile.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">O.K.:</span> Saves any information that has been added, modified or deleted and exits the profile.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Apply: </span>Saves any information that has been added, modified or deleted and keeps you in the profile.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Cancel:</span> Appears only if the profile has changes that have not been saved, abandons those changes and then exits the profile.</p>
            <h3><a name="Information_Tabs_..18" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Information Tabs</h3>
            <p>Each agent profile contains the following information tabs: <span>General Info, Communications, Remarks, Contacts, Activities, Travel History, Cards, Attachments, PNR Entries, More Fields, Groups, and Res Card Remarks.</span></p>
            <h3><a name="User-Defined_Fields_..19" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>User-Defined Fields</h3>
            <p>There are many fields in agent profiles that can be customized for agency’s use. While data entry fields are usually labeled in black, user-defined fields stand out because they are labeled in blue. By going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields</span> detailed lists of items of these fields can be added, edited, or deleted (or you can simply modify these areas by clicking on the blue label).</p>
            <h2><a name="Detailed_Review_of_Agent_Folders" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor57"></a>Detailed Review of Agent Folders</h2>
            <h3><a name="General_Info_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>General Info Tab </h3>
            <p>The General Information folder displays agent information. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 18 an in-depth look at agent profiles/an in depth look at agent_4.jpg" style="height: 389px;width: 585px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Agent%20Profiles.37.1.06.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Use the &lt;Tab&gt; key to move from field to field and &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; to move backwards from field to field; or use your mouse and click the desired field to enter data. The following fields are in the General Information folder:</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Type:</span> This field defaults to agent.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Agent Name:</span> Enter the name of agent. Any printed reports or labels include the <span class="span_2">Agent</span> name entered in the General Info folder.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Last Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the last name of agent. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">First Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the first name of the agent.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Middle</span><span>:</span> Enter the middle name of the agent.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Courtesy Title</span><span>:</span> Mr., Mrs., Mr. &amp; Mrs., Ms., Dr. are all examples of courtesy titles. The drop-down menu allows you to select from a lengthy, standardized list. The courtesy title is printed on mail labels. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Address 1, Address 2:</span> Profiles can include an unlimited number of addresses and may be designated as Primary, Bill To, Ship To, Second Address and Alternate Address. Only one address though may be assigned as Primary, one as Bill To and one as Ship To. </p>
            <p>From this area, setup a different Bill To, Ship To, Second Address and Alternative Address by clicking <span class="span_2">Additional Addresses</span>. The Second Address choice offers a date option. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Apt/Suite:</span> Enter the appropriate unit number.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">City/State/Zip:</span> Enter the city/state/zip data. These fields can be customized by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|City.State.or Zip</span>.</p>
            <h4><a name="PROFILE_STATUS_..20" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>PROFILE STATUS</h4>
            <p><span class="span_2">Create Date/Create User:</span> These fields default to the system date and the user logged in at the time the profile is created. Both can be modified, but can be disabled by the database administrator. Agencies use this field to query for new customers so that “Welcome to the Agency" letters can be mailed. These fields can also be used to query for management reports reflecting user productivity in creating new client profiles. </p>
            <p><span>Last Modified User/Last Modified Date: </span>This area indicates the last time a profile was modified and by whom.</p>
            <p><span>Profile Status: </span>Indicate whether a customer profile is active or inactive by choosing from the drop-down menu. By default all profiles start with an active status. An inactive status has been included, since you cannot delete a profile that has invoices and payments attached. When querying, only profiles marked as active are included in the search, but you can perform a Level 2 search to view inactive profiles.</p>
            <h4><a name="ADDITIONAL_INFO_..21" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>ADDITIONAL INFO</h4>
            <p><span class="span_2">Branch No.:</span> For agencies with multiple branches, enter the branch number (if applicable) from the drop-down menu. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Interface ID</span><span>: </span>In order to easily and consistently identify an existing customer or vendor within different applications used within the agency (<span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, your GDS, your Back Office etc.), a unique ID should be assigned to each profile. This ID is called the "Interface ID". As an example, this field is associated with the interfacing of records generated from the GDS (Front Office) to the agency accounting system (Back Office). If your agency works with client or vendor data within multiple systems then we strongly suggest creating a unique Interface ID for each profile. This field can be set as <span class="span_2">Required</span> and a default <span class="span_2">Value</span> can be automatically assigned when new profiles are created (see chapter <span class="span_2">Setting Up ClientBase for Your Agency)</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Salutation:</span> The name used to greet the contact; for example, if Mr. Henry Wilkenson likes to be called “Hank,” enter <span class="span_2">Hank</span> in this field. If Mrs. Emily Anderson likes to be called “Mrs. Anderson,” enter <span class="span_2">Mrs. Anderson</span> in this field.</p>
            <h4><a name="SPECIAL_DATES_..22" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>SPECIAL DATES</h4>
            <p>These fields are particularly useful to record unique dates for each specific customer. Enter the day/month/year (or any combination of these date fields) of the special date and choose the type by clicking the drop-down menu. Items in this list can be customized by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Special Dates</span>, or click on the blue label in the profile. Imagine the marketing possibilities, when several months before an anniversary, or vacation time, your agency suggests as a gift a trip reflecting the client’s preferences. By clicking <span class="span_2">Additional Special Dates</span>, unlimited dates can be added. </p>
            <h3><a name="Communications_Tab_..23" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Communications Tab</h3>
            <p>If you were on a previous version of ClientBase, communications have been moved out of the General Info tab of the Contact record into its own tab. The Primary Phone, Primary E-mail, Primary Fax, and Primary Web are now displayed in the list of Contacts on the Contacts tab in the profile. The first Communication entry of a given type is marked as the Contact's Primary (Primary box checked.) Subsequent communication entries of that type default to unchecked. </p>
            <p>By using the radio button on the top of the results screen, users can filter to view only one communications type at a time. Profile-level communication entries are displayed first, followed by the communications that are assigned to contacts. Contact communications are in the order that the contacts are listed in the Contacts tab. Profile level communications can be sorted using the blue arrows on the right side of the screen. These arrows are disabled when a Contact communication entry is selected. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Add, Modify, </span>or <span class="span_2">Delete</span> a communication entry. Deleting a communication entry works the same as before, unless the Contact is linked to more than one profile. In that case, the user is warned, <span class="span_2">This traveler is associated with multiple profiles. Deleting this communication will remove entry from those profiles also. Delete?</span> </p>
            <h4><a name="ADDING_A_COMMUNICATION_ENTRY_..24" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>ADDING A COMMUNICATION ENTRY</h4>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Add </span>to start:</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Contact:</span> Select the name of the contact from the drop-down. When adding a communication entry from the Contact level, there is no option to change the contact name by drop-down. </p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Type:</span> From the drop-down select the communication type - <span class="span_2">Phone, Fax, E-mail, Web Site, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google+. (</span>The standardized format for telephone, fax, e-mail and website entries in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides a platform upon which these numbers can be quickly moved among toolbar icons such as merging to e-mail, or merge to PNR.) </p>
            <p>Each <span class="span_2">phone </span>entry has a forced canonical country code and area code for the benefits of standardization described above. The prefix and suffix fields of the phone number field remain free-flow to accommodate foreign numbers. Maintain a default country code and area code in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults |Communication Defaults</span>. When entering new phone entries, if the country code and area code is not completed, the system defaults to the country code and area code in the Global Defaults. </p>
            <p class="p_3">Example Formats for capturing user's social media information:</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Facebook: </span>For a profile - facebook.com/username (facebook.com/JohnSmith); For a page - facebook.com/page name (facebook.com/SabreTravel)</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Twitter:</span> Twitter.com/username (Twitter.com/JohnSmith)</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Linked In:</span> linkedin.com/pub/8/b8a/205</p>
            <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Linked In ID)</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Google Plus:</span> plus.google.com/117474227900375467167</p>
            <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Google+ ID)</p>
            <p>Just like all other communication types, social media communication types have a Marketing Permission checkbox. Marketing Permission is unchecked by default.</p>
            <p>The social media Communication Types are in the Level 2 and Level 3 queries.</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Primary</span><span>:</span> One entry for each of these types can be designated as primary. Though an unlimited number of entries can be stored and viewed, the primary entries are marked with an asterisk on the main screen and included in export routines and used for merge to e-mail.</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Marketing Permission</span><span>:</span> All current e-mail addresses within the database default to this field being checked if setup by the database administrator in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|Communication Defaults</span>. On an e-mail entry by e-mail entry basis, choose to leave it checked or unchecked. This marketing permission checkbox is accessible through the global modify feature. So if you want the existing e-mail entries to have this permission marketing field unchecked, use global modify. </p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Invalid</span><span>: </span>This area is for use by a marketing organization or marketing person within the agency that has received something back as undeliverable. Rather than deleting the address or e-mail entirely from the database without the proper research, the marketing person can check the Invalid box signaling the fact that the agent should look into this further, but leaves it to the agent to determine how to update. Level 2 and Level 3 Profile Manager Queries have been updated to include the ability to filter profiles based on this address or e-mail Invalid status. Agencies should use these queries periodically to see if they have any Invalid addresses or e-mails that need updating. In the meantime, any addresses and e-mails with this Invalid setting will still be included in all Merge To features and reports.</p>
            <p>Need to copy a communication’s entry?&#160; Right-click on the entry and select <span class="span_2">Copy Phone, Copy E-Mail, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Copy Fax.&#160; </span>Then paste the entry into other applications as needed.</p>
            <h3><a name="Remarks_Tab_..25" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Remarks Tab</h3>
            <p>The Remarks folder provides a full-page view of the unlimited remarks and tremendous flexibility for entering comments into each agent profile. The only limitation in the <span class="span_2">Remarks</span> folder is the amount of available disk space. </p>
            <p>View any miscellaneous comments from this screen. This area includes a mini-word processor allowing an agency to customize free-flowing remarks:</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Spell Check:</span> Several dictionaries have automatically been installed onto each workstation running <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> providing you with the ability to identify misspellings within Document Templates. By default, while typing within any of these three areas, the spell check feature automatically underlines each misspelled word. Right-click on a misspelled word and you will be offered suggested spellings along with the ability to <span class="span_2">Ignore, Ignore All </span>or<span class="span_2"> Add</span> to Dictionary. In addition a Spell Check button, labeled <span class="span_2">ABC</span> has been added to the toolbar of the document templates allowing you to run the spell check routine across all data captured.</p>
            <h3><a name="Contacts_Tab_..26" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Contacts Tab</h3>
            <p>The <span class="span_2">Contact </span>folder is designed for detailed information on specific individuals who are key contacts within a profile. The blue up-and-down arrows allow re-ordering the list of contacts. The <span class="span_2">Reset Sorting</span> button which returns the list to alphabetical order. By highlighting a particular contact, you’ll be able to see any remarks entered in the contact record.</p>
            <p>Add a new traveler/contact by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. When a user adds a new contact record, the database is first automatically searched for any existing travelers/contacts that match. If a match is found, the user can select the existing contact from the list presented and click <span class="span_2">Link </span>to link the existing traveler/contact. They may also click <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> to return to their new traveler/contact. </p>
            <p>When clicking <span class="span_2">OK</span> again, the new traveler/contact is created. Any data that was entered while creating the new traveler/contact that did not exist in the linked traveler/contact record will be transferred.</p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> An agent enters a passport number when entering a new traveler/contact. The agent clicks OK, and search finds an existing traveler/contact record, but the existing record does not have a passport number. When the agent selects the matching traveler/contact record, and data from the traveler/contact record is populated on the screen, the passport information that was missing is now completed also.</p>
            <p><span>Conversely:</span> If data was entered and the existing traveler/contact record contains information in that field, the existing traveler/contact data is retained. <span class="span_2">Example:</span> Agent enters First Name, Last Name, and a birthdate of July 1, 1960, and then clicks OK. The traveler/contact Search results screen appears, and the agent decides to select one of the existing traveler/contact records. The existing traveler has a birthdate of April 12, 1965. The existing birthdate information overwrites the one the agent entered. (Users can always go back and edit if the original information was incorrect.)</p>
            <p>To modify or enhance a contact, click <span class="span_2">Modify</span> while the name is highlighted. If <span class="span_2">Unlink</span> is clicked for a traveler/contact that is not linked to any other profiles, then a prompt is presented warning that the traveler/contact will be deleted completely. If <span class="span_2">Unlink</span> is clicked for a traveler/contact that is linked to more than one profile, then a confirmation prompt is presented, advising that the traveler/contact will continue to exist in the other linked profiles. </p>
            <p>By click the <span class="span_2">Search </span>button, you can search for a contact that is located in another profile and attach the contact to this profile as well. </p>

            <p>There are 8 tabs of information in a traveler/contact record - <span class="span_2">General, Communications, Addresses, Advanced Contact Info, Cards, Travel Preferences, PNR Entries, and Associated Profiles. </span>Let’s take a look at how to organize information for each contact by going through each field of the add/modify screen. </p>
            <p>Notice the header in the Contact record, similar to the header of a profile. It displays Contact Name, Address, Communications, Salutation/Nickname, Relationship/Position, Department, Age, Primary Traveler indicator, Associated Profiles, and Birthday and Expired Credit Card/Passport notification icons.</p>
            <p>These two icons in the header are visual alerts of important dates:</p>

            </p>
            <p>A birthday present icon appears during the traveler's birthday month and disappears once the birthday month has passed. A red exclamation point icon appears if the traveler has an expired passport or credit card. Clicking on the exclamation point icon takes the user to Card record if it's an expired credit card, or to the Advanced Traveler Info tab if it's an expired passport. The icon disappears when the expiration date is updated. </p>

            <p><span class="span_2">Birthdate*</span><span>:</span> Enter contact’s birthdate including month, day and year, or any combination of those date fields. (If agent knows only month, enter it - you can query the database by month and send out birthday cards!)</p>
            <p><span>Age:</span> The Age field is auto-calculated based on the entries in the Birthdate fields. To auto-calculate the age, a year must be captured within the Birthdate and calculates based on the current date and the following logic: </p>
            <p>- If a year but no month and day is captured, the Age is calculated based on Jan 1st of the birth year.</p>
            <p>- If a month and year but no day is captured, the Age is calculated based on the 1st of the birth month and year.</p>
            <p>- If a day and year but no month is captured, the Age is calculated based on Jan as the birth month.</p>
            <p><span>Salutation/Nickname:</span> This field allows a salutation or nickname to be entered for each contact. The Salutation/Nickname can be viewed in the Profile Manager results by adding the column to the Query screen. </p>

            <p><span>Primary Contact: </span>Click here if this is the primary contact for this profile. By default, the box is checked for the contact added to the profile, designating them as Primary. For subsequent contacts added, the box is unchecked by default. If a user checks the box when adding a new contact, making them Primary, the box automatically will be unchecked for the original primary contact. There can be only one Primary Contact per profile. </p>
            <p><span>Remarks:</span> Enter unlimited free-flowing information pertaining to this contact.</p>

            <p>By using the radio button on the top of the results screen, filter to view only one communications type at a time. Sort communications using the blue arrows on the right side of the screen. <span class="span_2">Add, Modify, </span>or <span class="span_2">Delete</span> a communication entry. Deleting a communication entry works the same as before, unless the contact is linked to more than one profile.

            </p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Type:</span> From the drop-down select the communication type - <span class="span_2">Phone, Fax, E-mail, Web Site, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google+. (</span>The standardized format for telephone, fax, e-mail and website entries in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides a platform upon which these numbers can be quickly moved among toolbar icons such as merging to e-mail, or merge to PNR.) </p>
            <p>Each <span class="span_2">phone </span>entry has a forced canonical country code and area code for the benefits of standardization described above. The prefix and suffix fields of the phone number field remain free-flow to accommodate foreign numbers. Maintain a default country code and area code in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults |Communication Defaults</span>. When entering new phone entries, if the country code and area code is not completed, the system defaults to the country code and area code in the Global Defaults. </p>
            <p class="p_3">Example Formats for capturing user's social media information:</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Facebook: </span>For a profile - facebook.com/username (facebook.com/JohnSmith); For a page - facebook.com/page name (facebook.com/SabreTravel)</p>

            <p>Just like all other communication types, social media communication types have a Marketing Permission checkbox. Marketing Permission is unchecked by default.</p>
            <p>The social media Communication Types are in the Level 2 and Level 3 queries, as well as the Client Survey report.</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Primary</span><span>:</span> One entry for each of these types can be designated as primary. Though an unlimited number of entries can be stored and viewed, the primary entries are marked with an asterisk on the main screen and included in export routines and used for merge to e-mail.</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Marketing Permission</span><span>:</span> All current e-mail addresses within the database default to this field being checked if setup by the database administrator in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|Communication Defaults</span>. On an e-mail entry by e-mail entry basis, choose to leave it checked or unchecked. This marketing permission checkbox is accessible through the global modify feature. So if you want the existing e-mail entries to have this permission marketing field unchecked, use global modify. </p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Invalid</span><span class="span_3">:</span> This area is for use by a marketing organization or marketing person within the agency that has received something back as undeliverable. Rather than deleting the address or e-mail entirely from the database without the proper research, the marketing person can check the Invalid box signaling the fact that the agent should look into this further, but leaves it to the agent to determine how to update. Level 2 and Level 3 Profile Manager Queries have been updated to include the ability to filter profiles based on this address or e-mail Invalid status. Agencies should use these queries periodically to see if they have any Invalid addresses or e-mails that need updating. In the meantime, any addresses and e-mails with this Invalid setting will still be included in all Merge To features and reports.</p>

            <h3><a name="Travel_History_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Travel History Tab</h3>
            <p>From this window, agents can easily review past travel purchases which they sold as they appear in TBO or <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. They have read-only capabilities only. No information can be altered. The Travel History folder lists invoices created either in TBO or <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. This folder performs queries on the shared <span class="span_2">ClientBase/Trams Back Office</span> database and displays invoice/travel history involving this agent. Imagine each agent being able to see the invoices they’ve issued. </p>

The checkbox setting is "sticky" - once checked, it remains checked for all profiles until it is unchecked.

            <h3><a name="Cards_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Cards Tab</h3>
            <p>Keep track of the agent’s credit cards. Only cards that are not linked to a contact record can be modified or deleted from this profile area. If a user attempts to modify one that is linked to a contact, they will be prompted to continue to the contact record and modify it or delete it from there. </p>
            <h3><a name="Attachment_Tab_..39" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Attachment Tab</h3>
            <p>To enhance the amount and type of information accessible in a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile, a feature is included in all profile types so you can attach other files available on your local or network drive to this profiles. These files are referred to as <span class="span_2">Attachments</span>.</p>
            <p>To access an attachment at the agent level, click the <span class="span_2">Attachment Tab</span>. Attachments are listed alphabetically by <span class="span_2">Description</span>, and can be sorted from the drop-down menu by <span class="span_2">Description, File Name, Directory Path, Computer Name, Original File Source, Compressed Size, File Date/Time, or Modified Date/Time.</span></p>
            <p>To add a new attachment click <span class="span_2">Add</span>, and <span class="span_2">Browse for Attachment </span>to identity the File Path of the file. The File Path includes the drive where the file is located, any directories or sub-directories, and the name of the file. Choose to compress the file by clicking in the Compression box. Enter a brief description of the attachment, if desired. When retrieving a profile and viewing attachments, the attachments are listed alphabetically by <span class="span_2">Description</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> Although these file paths are created from one workstation, they are saved as part of the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database and so accessible from any <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> workstation.</p>
            <p>To view a saved attachment, highlight it, and click <span class="span_2">Open Attachment</span> or double-click on attachment to open. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses Windows association to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp, .html, etc.) and must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as MS Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the attachment created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
            <p>Modifications to a file launched from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> attachments can be saved automatically back into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. If an attachment is opened and then modified and saved, upon closing the attachment you land on the attachment settings window. Clicking <span class="span_2">OK </span>from this area saves the newly modified file back to <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>, while the name is highlighted, to remove an attachment. <span class="span_2">Save As Attachment</span> allows you to save a copy of the attachment into another file location.</p>
            <h3><a name="How_to_Set_Up_User_Level_Logos_in_Headers_Footers" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>How to Set Up User Level Logos in Headers/Footers</h3>
            <p>Logos can be added to Headers and Footers at the user level for use on Invoices, Itineraries, Trip Proposals, Trip Statements and Receipts. Some agencies have the need for an agent to have his or her own unique branding to appear on Invoice, Statements, etc. (such as agents that are Independent Contractors). To use the agent logo feature, it is necessary to add the agent's logo to the Agent's profile and to add the <span class="span_2">Primary Agent Logo</span> merge field to Headers and Footers.</p>
            <p>Next, query and select the agent profile, click the Attachments tab and <span class="span_2">Add</span>. There are two Attachment Types of Logo and General (for attachments other than logos). Select Logo, then Browse for Attachment and select the agent's logo image. Agent's logo image must be a *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.bmp, *.ico, or *.emf type graphic file. Make sure it's the correct size before you import it. Complete the Description field and click OK to save.</p>

            </p>
            <p>After saving the agent logo, select the desired Header and Footer (Invoice, Trip Proposal, Receipt, etc.). Double-click on the global logo image to open the Picture Designer. </p>
            <p>Do not change the current logo image. Click the down arrow on the <span class="span_2">Merge Field</span>, select Primary Agent Logo from the drop down and click OK to save. Repeat these steps to add the Primary Agent Logo merge field to each Header and Footer (Invoice, Trip Proposal, Receipt, etc.).</p>
            <p>If a logo exists in the Agent Profile, that logo is merged on to the document as long as the Primary Agent Logo merge field is in the Header and Footer. If no logo exists in the Agent Profile, or if the agent's user login does not have an assigned Agent Profile, the agency's usual Header and Footer is used (Branch level or the Global level).</p>

            </p>
            <p>A PNR Entry table is available at the agent profile level so that you can format miscellaneous remarks for this agent and then seamlessly paste them into a PNR. PNR Entry tables are also included at the branch, client and traveler levels. Agent profiles can be identified within their User Login record. By default the User Login Agent’s PNR Entries are included when using the Merge to PNR feature in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">CRS</span><span>:</span> Choose the GDS system from the drop-down menu.</p>

            <p><span class="span_2">Always Move this Entry</span><span>:</span> By checking this box, the entry always moves when you do a move to the PNR. If this box is not checked, you’ll have the option of moving the entry whenever you want.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Assign Name Field Position</span><span>:</span> When checked, automatically attaches the traveler’s name position at the end of the PNR entry (e.g. 3SSRVGML-1.2).</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Display on Selection Screen</span><span>:</span> Within each PNR Entry or PNR Rule that is set as <span class="span_2">Always Move This Rule</span>, an option is included called Display on Selection Screen. The PNR Selection Screen is the screen that appears when you use the Merge to PNR feature and allows you to select the specific profile data to be included and sent to the current PNR. For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this <span class="span_2">Display on Selection Screen</span> can be unchecked so that the Selection Screen is less complicated for the agent to review. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">PNR</span><span>:</span> Enter the PNR entry the way you would in your reservation system and press OK to save. For more information on moving data from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to your CRS PNR, please refer to the chapter, <span class="span_2">Putting Your Profiles to Work for You.</span></p>
