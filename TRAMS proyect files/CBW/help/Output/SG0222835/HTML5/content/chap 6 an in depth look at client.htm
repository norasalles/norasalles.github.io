            <p class="p_36">This chapter outlines setting up, maintaining and using Client Profiles.</p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..90" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's marketplace travel agencies are finding a need to shift focus away from just being order takers and processing transactions. In order to survive and profit, it has become imperative for an agency to service its clients and strengthen its relationships to build and retain client loyalty. The information within the leisure and corporate profiles provides an important tool to achieve this goal.</p>
            <p>Using information in client profiles, agents can launch letters from document templates, print labels, merge to e-mail, manage booking and invoice information on reservation cards, post notes, create reminders and mailers, add attachments, move client information into a PNR and more!</p>
            <h2><a name="Types_of_Client_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Types of Client Profiles</h2>
            <p>Within <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> there are two types of client profiles - Leisure and Corporate. A leisure profile represents a leisure client's household. For example, a profile would be created for Mr. and Mrs. John Smith and each member of the household would be listed individually under the <span class="span_40">Travelers</span> tab. John would be the "Primary", Karen designated as "Wife", James as "Son" and Jesse as "Daughter". Travelers can be linked to multiple profiles.</p>
            <p>Corporate profiles are created for each of your corporate clients. Each profile can contain any number of contacts who are company travelers. These are listed in the client profile in the <span class="span_40">Travelers </span>tab. As a traveler in ClientBase can be linked to multiple profiles, a contact may also be linked to a leisure profile as well.</p>
            <h2><a name="Anatomy_of_a_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Anatomy of a Profile</h2>
            <p class="p_16">

            </p>
            <p>A client profile stores an unlimited amount of information about your customers. To organize all this information and make it easily accessible to all agents, each profile is made up of seven key areas: <span class="span_40">File Menu Items, Toolbar, Header Info, Scrolling Arrows, Profile Indicators, Control Buttons, Information Tabs, and User-Defined Fields.</span></p>
            <p>Let’s explore each of these seven key areas.</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor101"></a><span class="Heading3Char">File Menu Items</span>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p><span><br /></span>When in a profile, access file menu items to hop into another program feature. When you want to return to the open profile, click <span class="span_40">Windows</span> and on the profile from the bottom of the list.</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor102"></a><span class="Heading3Char">Toolbar</span><span><br /></span><span><img src="resources/images/chapter 6 an in-depth look at client profiles/an in depth look at client_1.jpg" style="height: 66px;width: 573px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20a%20Client%20Profile.10.1.02.jpg" class="img_1" /></span>
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p><span>Create a Reminder:</span> Click the <span class="span_40">Remind</span> icon to create an activity such as following up on a brochure sent to a client. Fill in the date to be reminded, set the priority, reminder type, set an optional alarm and finally type in some free-flowing remarks for reference. Put a time on the reminder so that it appears on your daily calendar, At A Glance in the scheduled time slot, or tag the reminder as a To-Do (timeless) so it appears on a To-Do list on your daily calendar. There is also an option to mark this reminder <span class="span_40">Private</span> so that only the creation agent or SYSDBA can view it. This reminder appears within the profile’s activities tab, on your At A Glance and as part of your queries in the Activity Manager or reports.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Note:</span> Click the <span class="span_40">Note</span> icon to create a note documenting any contact you’ve had with a client such as a client question or concern. By entering the date, time, and subject of the contact, a history of contacts is created and stored within the profile’s Activity Tab. This history appears in the Activity Manager and on reports.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Mailer:</span> Click the <span class="span_40">Mailer</span> icon to create a mailer (history) of something you’ve sent to a customer; for example, a birthday card or a ski trip promotion. By entering the date, time, and subject of the mailer, the history appears within the profile’s Activity Tab in the Activity Manager or on reports.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Res Card:</span> Click the <span class="span_40">Res Card</span> icon to create a reservation card for trips. Track a trip from its inception to its completion. All vendor/service provider information is included, as well as, all other trip details. No more manually kept Res Cards! By entering details of the trip in progress (or by using Live Connect to pull data in from booking on-line), client balances and details of the trip can be accessed. </p>
            <p><a name="kanchor103"></a><span>Create a Receipt:</span> In cases where you are not yet ready to issue an invoice, but have received money from a client, possibly for a gift certificate or payment between deposit and final payment or payment before confirming something, a receipt can be issued in the Client Profile giving the agent a new tool for printing a document for the customer and receipting the payment as a voucher on the client's account in <span class="span_40">Trams Back Office</span>. </p>
            <p>Please note that any receipts issued from the <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> profile are not currently linked to a Res Card.&#160; But because a Receipt creates a voucher, users of Trams Back Office, can apply these vouchers to invoices that are issued later by a Res Card  </p>

            </p>
            <p>The header conveniently displays pertinent information including the current mailing address, the first five communication entries captured for this profile, number of Marketing Codes, Primary Traveler, Groups, Voucher Balance, Primary Agent, Profile Create Date, Salutation, Interface ID, and Profile No. By confirming the accuracy of this information, and adding any new details each time a customer calls, the agent ensures that the client’s information and therefore the agency marketing data is always up-to-date. </p>
            <p>The header displays the first five Communication entries, in the order they are listed on the profile's Communications tab. If there are not five entries at the profile level, then the primary traveler's communications are displayed next, in the order they are listed on the primary traveler's communications tab. If there still are not 5 communications to display, then ClientBase picks up from the other travelers listed on the Travelers tab, in the order they are listed there, until all five slots are filled. </p>
            <p>The items in the header are clickable. When clicked, the user is taken to that section of the profile. For example, when the Marketing Codes count is clicked, the Marketing tab opens; when the Primary Traveler is clicked, that Traveler record opens. </p>

            <p>The <span class="span_40">General Information</span> tab displays the primary client data for this household or business. Use the &lt;Tab&gt; key to move from field to field and &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; to move backwards from field to field; or click the desired field to enter data.</p>
            <h4><a name="GENERAL_INFO" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>GENERAL INFO</h4>
            <p><span class="span_40">Type: </span>Defaults to type (leisure or corporate) that was selected when profile was created. Change the profile type at any time; however, by simply selecting from the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Company</span><span class="span_40">:</span> In a corporate profile, enter the name. Any printed reports or labels can include the <span class="span_40">Company</span> name entered in the general Info folder.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Last Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the last name of primary contact in household or business. Any printed reports or labels can include the <span class="span_40">First</span> and <span class="span_40">Last Name</span> entered in the general info folder.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">First Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the first name(s) of the primary contact(s) in this field.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Middle</span><span>: </span>Enter the complete middle name of the primary contact in the field.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Courtesy Title</span><span>:</span> Mr., Mrs., Mr. &amp; Mrs., Ms., Dr. are all examples of courtesy titles. The drop-down menu allows you to select from a lengthy standardized list. This courtesy title is printed on mailing labels or on letters in the document templates. This field can be customized by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Courtesy Title</span>, or by clicking the blue field name.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Additional Name: </span>This field is for capturing another name within a single household. For example, John Smith has a wife Mary but Mary still uses her maiden name of Jones. All correspondence should be addressed to both John and Mary. Enter John's name in the Last/First fields and enter Mary Jones in the new additional name field. Mailing label would appear as:</p>
            <p>John Smith</p>
            <p>Mary Jones</p>
            <p>Address</p>
            <p>City, State Zip </p>
            <p>The additional name field is a one line field and can contain up to 80 characters. This field can be merged to Documents, Labels and E-mails. It is also now a part of Level 2 and Level 3 profile queries. When creating a new profile the additional name entry is also added to the Travelers tab by default.</p>
            <h4><a name="ADDRESS_INFO" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>ADDRESS INFO</h4>
            <p>A client profile can include an unlimited number of addresses and they may be designated as <span class="span_40">Primary, Bill To, Ship To, Second Address </span>and <span class="span_40">Alternate Address</span>. Only one address though may be assigned as <span class="span_40">Primary</span>, one as <span class="span_40">Bill To</span> and one as <span class="span_40">Ship To</span>. </p>
            <p>Assuming the address to be captured is the default type of <span class="span_40">Primary, Bill To </span>and <span class="span_40">Ship To</span>, then the address fields of <span class="span_40">Address Line 1</span>, <span class="span_40">Address Line 2</span>, <span class="span_40">Apt/Suite, Zip Code, City, State </span>and <span class="span_40">Country </span>can be entered right from the main screen. To capture additional address entries, such as a second address or alternate address, click <span class="span_40">Additional Addresses</span>.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 6 an in-depth look at client profiles/chapter 6 an in-depth look at client profiles_5.jpg" style="height: 298px;width: 317px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20a%20Client%20Profile.10.1.12.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>From this area, you can setup a different <span class="span_40">Bill To, Ship To, Second Address </span>and<span class="span_40"> Alternate Address</span> along with a description for each. The second address choice offers a date option. This is particularly useful because it allows entry of a specific time frame your client may be residing at the second address. This time frame can be taken into account when generating labels and document templates from <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span>.</p>
            <p>If multiple address records are captured for a given profile, an easy way of viewing each address record is by clicking <span class="span_40">Additional Address</span>. This displays a drop-down list of each address record. Centered just above the Address Line 1, in a gray box, is the current address type/s associated with this address record.</p>
            <p>If a customer does not want to have marketing materials sent to the address, uncheck this box.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 6 an in-depth look at client profiles/chapter 6 an in-depth look at client profiles_6.jpg" style="height: 349px;width: 339px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20a%20Client%20Profile.10.1.13.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>There is also an <span class="span_40">Invalid</span> checkbox for use by a marketing organization or marketing person within the agency that has received something back as undeliverable. Rather than deleting the address or e-mail entirely from the database without the proper research, the marketing person can check the <span class="span_40">Invalid</span> box signaling the fact that the agent should look into this further, but leaves it to the agent to determine how to update. </p>
            <p>Level 2 and Level 3 Profile Manager Queries have been updated to include the ability to filter profiles based on this address or e-mail Invalid status. Agencies should use these queries periodically to see if they have any Invalid addresses or e-mails that need updating. In the meantime, any addresses and e-mails with this Invalid setting will still be included in all <span class="span_40">Merge To</span> features and reports.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Zip/City/State/Country</span>: Wonder why we put the zip code ahead of the city and state? We did this purposely to try and save you data entry time, and to make sure complete addresses are entered. For many agencies, it is common that a large percentage of the profiles captured are regional to their location. With this in mind, the global list of drop-down zip codes created by your agency can default the desired city, state and zip. For example, let’s say there are several clients in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275. Add 90275 to the drop-down list of zip codes, and at the same time default the city to Rancho Palos Verdes, the state to CA and the country to USA. Any time you add a client to your database in this area, by entering the zip code and tabbing, the city and state automatically defaults. </p>
            <p>One last point is when it comes to agency databases, zip codes are notorious for being incomplete, incorrect or just overlooked entirely. Placing the zip code before the city and state emphasizes the importance of this field. </p>
            <h4><a name="PROFILE_STATUS_..99" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>PROFILE STATUS</h4>
            <p class="p_12">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 6 an in-depth look at client profiles/chapter 6 an in-depth look at client profiles_7.jpg" style="height: 96px;width: 530px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20a%20Client%20Profile.10.1.14.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Create Date/Create User:</span> These fields default to the system date and the user logged in at the time the profile is created. Both can be modified, but can be disabled by the database administrator. Agencies use this field to query for new customers so that “Welcome to the Agency" letters can be mailed. These fields can also be used to query for management reports reflecting user productivity in creating new client profiles. </p>
            <p><span>Last Modified User/Last Modified Date: </span>This area indicates the last time a profile was modified and by whom.</p>
            <p><span>Profile Status: </span>Indicate whether a customer profile is active or inactive by choosing from the drop-down menu. By default all profiles start with an active status. An inactive status has been included, since you cannot delete a profile that has invoices and payments attached. When querying, only profiles marked as active are included in the search, but you can perform a Level 2 search to view inactive profiles.</p>
            <h4><a name="ADDITIONAL_INFO_..100" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>ADDITIONAL INFO</h4>
            <p><span class="span_40">Branch No.:</span> For agencies with multiple branches, this field allows an agent to select from a drop-down menu the branch at which this profile was created or that you want the profile associated with. Branches are setup in <span>Utilities|Branch</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Primary Agent:</span> This field defaults to the login agent at the time the profile is created. It can be modified to represent the appropriate agent considered primary to the customer or left blank.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Interface ID</span><span>: </span>In order to easily and consistently identify an existing customer or vendor within different applications used within the agency (<span class="span_40">ClientBase</span>, your GDS, your Back Office etc.), a unique ID should be assigned to each profile. This ID is called the "Interface ID". As an example, this field is associated with the interfacing of records generated from the GDS (Front Office) to the agency accounting system (Back Office). If your agency works with client or vendor data within multiple systems then we strongly suggest creating a unique Interface ID for each profile. This field can be set as <span class="span_40">Required</span> and a default <span class="span_40">Value</span> can be automatically assigned when new profiles are created (see chapter <span class="span_40">Setting Up ClientBase for Your Agency)</span>. </p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Membership ID: </span>This field is used at the profile level to capture any special identification number assigned by the agency to the customer account. The database administrator has to set this up for use so it is visible in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|Membership ID Fields.</span></p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Salutation:</span> The name used to greet the customer. For example, if Mr. Henry Wilkenson likes to be called “Hank,” enter <span class="span_40">Hank</span> in this field. If Mrs. Emily Anderson likes to be called “Mrs. Anderson,” enter <span class="span_40">Mrs. Anderson</span> in this field. Or, if you have a couple and want to include both names when addressing letters, enter <span class="span_40">Hank and Emily</span>, or <span class="span_40">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Anderson</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Web ID/Web Password:</span> If your agency is interested in using your website to collect and update customer information, these fields may become important, as most systems require a Web ID and Password to provide access to this type of customer information. Advise your website designer that customer data can be easily exported and imported from <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> and integrating these ASCII files with your website is something they may want to consider. There is also an XML Import and Export utility for efficient data exchange. E-mail support@<span class="span_40">Trams</span>.com for more information.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Referred By:</span> By using the drop-down menu, enter how this client was referred to your agency. Customize this field by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Referred By</span>, or by clicking the blue field label. Statistics can be obtained from <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> reporting to get a bird’s eye view of how new customers are learning of your agency. What a great way to evaluate the effectiveness of your advertising! </p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Special Dates:</span> These fields are particularly useful to record unique dates for each specific customer. Enter the day/month/year (or any combination of these date fields) of the special date and choose the type by clicking the drop-down menu. Items in this list can be customized by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Special Dates</span>, or click on the blue label in the profile. Imagine the marketing possibilities, when several months before an anniversary, or vacation time, your agency suggests as a gift a trip reflecting the client’s preferences. By clicking <span class="span_40">Additional Special Dates</span>, unlimited dates can be added. <span>Tip: </span>Birthdays do not go in this area. Best practice is to put them into each traveler’s info area. </p>

            <p>The Primary Phone, Primary E-mail, Primary Fax, and Primary Web are displayed in the list of Travelers/Contacts on the Travelers or Contacts tab in the profile (in Leisure clients, this tab is called Travelers; in Corporate clients, this tab is called Contacts.) The first Communication entry of a given type is marked as the Traveler's Primary (Primary box checked.) Subsequent communication entries of that type default to unchecked. </p>
            <p>By using the radio button on the top of the results screen, users can filter to view only one communications type at a time. Profile-level communication entries are displayed first, followed by the communications that are assigned to traveler/contacts. Traveler/Contact communications are in the order that they travelers are listed in the Travelers/Contacts tab.

            <p>Each <span class="span_40">phone </span>entry has a forced canonical country code and area code for the benefits of standardization described above. The prefix and suffix fields of the phone number field remain free-flow to accommodate foreign numbers.

When entering new phone entries, if the country code and area code is not completed, the system defaults to the country code and area code in the Global Defaults. </p>

            <p>The <span class="span_40">Marketing</span> folder provides the means of tracking client interests and travel preferences and arms selling agents with key information during the qualifying process of selling leisure travel. Marketing tables are powerful links to clients with common travel interests when planning a direct mail campaign or planning group travel. Reports showing the travel preferences of your customers are extremely valuable in matching up customers and travel specials. </p>
            <p>The marketing tab contains an unlimited number of user-defined marketing tables. Each of the tables in this folder includes a user-defined header and an unlimited number of user-defined marketing codes. These headers and marketing codes are “global,” meaning the same tables are in every profile at every workstation. </p>
            <p>When first installing the <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> software, some of the marketing tables come with default headers and default marketing codes. These default tables can be modified, enhanced, or deleted. The default tables are included to give users basic ideas about what information might be collected for effective marketing. For instructions on tailoring your user-definable marketing tables and marketing codes, please refer to the chapter of this manual entitled, <span class="span_40">Set Up ClientBase for Your Agency</span>.</p>
            <p>To select and insert marketing codes into a client profile, use double up and down arrows to scroll between tables. Select the codes that apply by clicking in the box on the left hand of each category. Notice that a summary of marketing tables and codes applicable to this customer is displayed on the left hand side of the screen. To de-select marketing codes, simply uncheck each box. Remember that customer’s needs often change. Removing marketing information when no longer valid is as important as entering new information.</p>

The blue up-and-down arrows allow re-ordering the list of Travelers/Contacts. (The sort order is reflected in Merge to PNR, except for Amadeus, which still requires alphabetical order. Sort order is not reflected in Reports, Res Card Traveler List, Live Connect or File Export. The Corporate, Vendor, and Other profiles have a "Reset Sorting" button which returns the list to alphabetical order.) </p>
            <p>By highlighting a particular traveler or contact, you’ll be able to see any remarks entered in the traveler or contact record.</p>
            <p>Add a new traveler/contact by clicking <span class="span_40">Add</span>. (Clicking <span class="span_40">Search</span> first is the fastest way to link a traveler already in the system to a profile.)<span class="span_40">&#160; </span>When a user adds a new Traveler record, the database is first automatically searched for any existing Travelers that match. If a match is found, the user can select the existing traveler from the list presented and click <span class="span_40">Link </span>to link the existing traveler. They may also click <span class="span_40">Cancel</span> to return to their new Traveler. </p>
            <p>When clicking <span class="span_40">OK</span> again, the new Traveler is created. Any data that was entered while creating the new Traveler that did not exist in the linked Traveler record will be transferred.</p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> An agent enters a passport number when entering a new Traveler. The agent clicks OK, and search finds an existing traveler record, but the existing record does not have a passport number. When the agent selects the matching traveler record, and data from the traveler record is populated on the screen, the passport information that was missing is now completed also.</p>
            <p><span>Conversely:</span> If data was entered and the existing Traveler record contains information in that field, the existing Traveler data is retained. <span class="span_40">Example:</span> Agent enters First Name, Last Name, and a birthdate of July 1, 1960, and then clicks OK. The Traveler Search results screen appears, and the agent decides to select one of the existing Traveler records. The existing traveler has a birthdate of April 12, 1965. The existing birthdate information overwrites the one the agent entered. (Users can always go back and edit if the original information was incorrect.)</p>
            <p>To modify or enhance a traveler/contact, click <span class="span_40">Modify</span> while the name is highlighted.  If <span class="span_40">Unlink</span> is clicked for a Traveler that is not linked to any other profiles, then a prompt is presented warning that the Traveler will be deleted completely. If <span class="span_40">Unlink</span> is clicked for a Traveler that is linked to more than one profile, then a confirmation prompt is presented, advising that the Traveler will continue to exist in the other linked profiles. </p>
            <p>By clicking the <span class="span_40">Search </span>button, you can search for a traveler or contact that is located in another profile and attach the traveler or contact to this profile as well.&#160; Once you click <span class="span_40">Search, </span>click on the <span class="span_40">Associated Profiles button </span>to easily identify the desired Traveler when multiple matches are found.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Search by phone or e-mail address alone, or in combination with any of the name fields. If searching by name only, users must enter something in at least two of the three name fields.</p>
            <p class="p_12">Examples: </p>
            <p>**User enters First Name of Ken and an e-mail address of ken@example.com. Ken Able, who has that address, is returned; Ken Jones, who does not have that e-mail address, is not.</p>
            <p>**User knows the last name, but isn't sure exactly how the first name is spelled. He enters First Name A and last name Smith. All Travelers whose first name starts with A (Alice, Anne, Alex,) and last name starts with Smith (Smith, Smith-Jones) are returned.</p>
            <p>**User knows that Mary Anne Jones has married, but doesn't remember the Traveler's new last name. She enters First Name Mary and Middle Name Anne. All Travelers with that first and middle name are returned.</p>
            <p>**User knows the traveler's phone number and enters (650) 555-1212. All travelers with that phone number are returned. </p>

            <p>There are 8 tabs of information in a traveler/contact record: </p>

            <p><span class="span_40">General, Communications, Addresses, Advanced Traveler/Contact Info, Cards, Travel Preferences, PNR Entries, and Associated Profiles. </span>Let’s take a look at how to organize information for each traveler/contact by going through each field of the add/modify screen. </p>
            <p>Notice the header in the Traveler/Contact record, similar to the header of a profile. It displays Traveler/Contact Name, Address, Communications, Salutation/Nickname, Relationship/Position, Department, Age, Primary Traveler indicator, Associated Profiles, and Birthday and Expired Credit Card/Passport notification icons.</p>
            <p>These two icons in the header are visual alerts of important dates:</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>A birthday present icon appears during the traveler's birthday month and disappears once the birthday month has passed. A red exclamation point icon appears if the traveler has an expired passport or credit card. Clicking on the exclamation point icon takes the user to Card record if it's an expired credit card, or to the Advanced Traveler Info tab if it's an expired passport. The icon disappears when the expiration date is updated. </p>

            <p><span class="span_40">Relationship with Profile/Position: </span>By choosing from a drop-down menu, these user-definable items can be inserted. (Go to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup||User Define Fields|Traveler Relationship</span> to set up for <span class="span_40">Leisure</span> profiles and <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Define Fields|Contact Position</span> to set up for <span class="span_40">Corporate</span> profiles; or simply click on the blue label to modify.) By identifying the traveler as a daughter or son in<span class="span_40"> Leisure</span> Profiles; Sales Rep or V.P. in <span class="span_40">Corporate</span> Profiles, agents have an advantage when talking to a customer and can personalize their service.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Courtesy Title</span><span>:</span> Mr., Mrs., Mr. &amp; Mrs., Ms., Dr. are all examples of courtesy titles. The drop-down menu allows you to select from a lengthy customized list (setup by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Courtesy Title</span>, or click on the blue label). This courtesy title can printed on mail labels and letters.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">First Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the legal first name of the traveler/contact in this field. This provides correct information for booking purposes. </p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Middle Name*: </span>Enter the legal middle name (for international traveling purposes).</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Last Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the legal last name of traveler/contact. </p>

            <p><span class="span_40">Birthdate*</span><span>:</span> Enter traveler’s birthdate including month, day and year, or any combination of those date fields. (If agent knows only month, enter it - you can Query database by month and send out your birthday cards!.)</p>
            <p><span>Age:</span> The Age field is auto-calculated based on the entries in the Birthdate fields. To auto-calculate the age, a year must be captured within the Birthdate and calculates based on the current date and the following logic: </p>
            <p>- If a year but no month and day is captured, the Age is calculated based on Jan 1st of the birth year.</p>
            <p>- If a month and year but no day is captured, the Age is calculated based on the 1st of the birth month and year.</p>
            <p>- If a day and year but no month is captured, the Age is calculated based on Jan as the birth month.</p>
            <p><span>Salutation/Nickname:</span> This field allows a salutation or nickname to be entered for each traveler/contact. The Salutation/Nickname can be viewed in the Profile Manager results by adding the column to the Query screen. </p>
            <p>Once a Merge to PNR rule is setup, the Salutation/Nickname can be merged to the GDS. Level 2 and 3 queries contain a filter for this new field, so you can Query by your client's nickname. Also, this field has been added as a merge field (Traveler/Contact Salutation) that can be used on labels, document templates, and e-mails.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Associate ID: </span>This field is used at the traveler level to capture any special identification number assigned by the agency to the customer account. The database administrator has to set this up for use in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|Membership ID Fields.</span></p>
            <p><span>Department:</span> In corporate profiles, there is a field to enter the contact’s department.</p>
            <p><span>Primary Traveler: </span>Click here if this is the primary traveler or contact for this profile. By default, the box is checked for the first Traveler or Contact added to the profile, designating them as Primary. For subsequent travelers and contacts added, the box is unchecked by default. If a user checks the box when adding a new traveler or contact, designating them as Primary, the box automatically will be unchecked for the original primary traveler/contact. There can be only one Primary Traveler/Contact per profile. </p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> Because the Primary Traveler checkbox has been added, agencies may wish to use Global Modify to change the Primary relationship to another value, as the new checkbox provides a better way to identify Primary Travelers. Therefore, the field PROFILE.Traveler Relationship was added to the Profile Fields tab in the Global Modify tool. With a Traveler column included in the results of a query, it is now possible to use Global Modify to change the relationship of the Travelers to their Profiles in a batch.</p>

            </p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Traveler:</span> Select the name of the traveler from the drop-down. When adding a communication entry from the Traveler level, there is no option to change the traveler name by drop-down. </p>
            <p><span class="span_12">Type:</span> From the drop-down select the communication type - <span class="span_40">Phone, Fax, E-mail, Web Site, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Google+. (</span>The standardized format for telephone, fax, e-mail and website entries in <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> provides a platform upon which these numbers can be quickly moved among toolbar icons such as merging to e-mail, or merge to PNR.) </p>
            <p>Each <span class="span_40">phone </span>entry has a forced canonical country code and area code for the benefits of standardization described above. The prefix and suffix fields of the phone number field remain free-flow to accommodate foreign numbers. Maintain a default country code and area code in <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults |Communication Defaults</span>. When entering new phone entries, if the country code and area code is not completed, the system defaults to the country code and area code in the Global Defaults. </p>
            <p class="p_12">Example Formats for capturing user's social media information:</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Facebook: </span>For a profile - facebook.com/username (facebook.com/JohnSmith); For a page - facebook.com/page name (facebook.com/SabreTravel)</p>

            <p>Just like all other communication types, social media communication types have a Marketing Permission checkbox. Marketing Permission is unchecked by default.</p>
            <p>The social media Communication Types are in the Level 2 and Level 3 queries, as well as the Client Survey report.</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Primary</span><span>:</span> One entry for each of these types can be designated as primary. Though an unlimited number of entries can be stored and viewed, the primary entries are marked with an asterisk on the main screen and included in export routines and used for merge to e-mail.</p>
            <p><span>Note: </span><span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> formats e-mail entries with the special characters that the GDS does not accept which means the proper e-mail entry can be stored in <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> for e-mailing purposes, and those entries can be sent with the <span class="span_40">Merge to PNR</span> accommodating the GDS formats:</p>

On an e-mail entry by e-mail entry basis, choose to leave it checked or unchecked. This marketing permission checkbox is accessible through the global modify feature. So if you want the existing e-mail entries to have this permission marketing field unchecked, use global modify. </p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Invalid</span><span>:</span> This area is for use by a marketing organization or marketing person within the agency that has received something back as undeliverable. Rather than deleting the address or e-mail entirely from the database without the proper research, the marketing person can check the Invalid box signaling the fact that the agent should look into this further, but leaves it to the agent to determine how to update. Level 2 and Level 3 Profile Manager Queries have been updated to include the ability to filter profiles based on this address or e-mail Invalid status. Agencies should use these queries periodically to see if they have any Invalid addresses or e-mails that need updating. In the meantime, any addresses and e-mails with this Invalid setting will still be included in all Merge To features and reports.</p>

Under this tab each travel category appears in a new tree view. Travel Categories are listed in the tree on the left side and Travel Preferences for each are on the right. This gives the ability to capture travel preferences globally by Travel Category, but also the ability to capture travel preferences for each preferred Vendor. It is not mandatory to have preferred preferences for a preferred vendor. It is also not mandatory to select preferred vendors for a client. </p>
            <p>Click the Travel Category name to view and/or set up global travel preferences for the category.

            <p>In order to capture traveler-related PNR entries (such as general remarks, special meal requests, air/car/hotel preference, UDID’s, etc.), a tab is included in the traveler/contact record for leisure and corporate client profiles. Use <span class="span_40">Add, Modify,</span> and <span class="span_40">Delete</span> to maintain specific PNR entries for each traveler. There are no limits to the number of PNR entries captured in this table. Each PNR entry is made up of the following fields:</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">CRS</span><span>: </span>Choose your GDS system from the drop-down menu.</p>

            <p>To enhance the amount and type of information accessible in a profile, a feature is included in all profile types allowing you to point to other files available on your local or network drive. These files are referred to as <span class="span_40">Attachments</span>. To access an attachment at the client level, click the <span class="span_40">Attachment Tab</span>. Attachments are listed alphabetically by <span class="span_40">Description</span>, and can be sorted from the drop-down menu by <span class="span_40">Description, File Name, Directory Path, Computer Name, Original File Source, Compressed Size, File Date/Time, or Modified Date/Time.</span></p>

            <p>To add a new attachment, click <span class="span_40">Add</span>, and <span class="span_40">Browse for Attachment </span>to identity the file path which includes the drive where the file is located, any directories or sub-directories, and the name of the file. Choose to compress the file by clicking in the compression box. Enter a brief description of the attachment, if desired. When retrieving a profile and viewing attachments, the attachments are listed alphabetically by <span class="span_40">Description</span>. Although these file paths are created from one workstation, they are saved as part of your <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> database and so accessible from any <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> workstation.</p>
            <p>To view a saved attachment, highlight the attachment, and click <span class="span_40">Open Attachment, </span>or double-click on attachment to open. <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> uses Windows association to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every computer file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp, .html, etc.) must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the attachment created in <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span>. </p>
            <p>Modifications to a file launched from <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> attachments can be saved automatically back into <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span>. If an attachment is opened and then modified and saved, upon closing the attachment you land on the attachment settings window. Clicking <span class="span_40">OK </span>from this area saves the newly modified file back to <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span>. Click <span class="span_40">Delete</span>, while the name is highlighted, to remove an attachment. <span class="span_40">Save As Attachment</span> allows you to save a copy of the attachment into another file location.</p>
            <p><span>Note</span><span>s</span><span>: </span>If the size of the file is too large you will receive the message, <span class="span_40">The compressed attachment you are trying to load is too large.

            </p>
            <p>Setup the name of the field by going to <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|More Field Categories</span> and adding a <span class="span_40">Category Name</span>. To create a drop-down list of entry defaults, go to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|More Fields </span>and click <span class="span_40">Add</span>. Once setup, the field name assigned appears in the More Fields tab of all profiles, and entries can be made by free-flowing into the field or selecting from the drop-down list of default entries. Any fields setup in the More Fields tab are global, meaning the field name and drop-down default list appears in all profiles at all workstations. <span>Hint: </span>More Fields categories and more field items are difficult to delete. It might be better to use a marketing code or a group name for temporary tagging, since these can be easily removed by using global modify. </p>
