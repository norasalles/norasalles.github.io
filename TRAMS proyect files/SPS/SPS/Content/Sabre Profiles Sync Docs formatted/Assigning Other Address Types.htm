            <li class="li_1">The first Billing Address will be inserted as the Bill To address. </li>
            <li class="li_1">The first Delivery Address will become the Ship To address. </li>
            <li class="li_1">Any additional Billing, Delivery, or uncategorized addresses will be inserted into ClientBase without a type. </li>
            <li class="li_1">If there is only one address in Sabre Profiles, and no address in ClientBase, it is inserted as one address with the Primary, Bill To, and Ship To boxes checked. </li>
            <li class="li_1">If two or more Sabre Profiles addresses are the same, we insert it into ClientBase only once and check all the applicable address type boxes. For example, if there are two Sabre Profile addresses, but one is Billing and one is Delivery, we will insert them as one address with both Bill To and Ship To checked in ClientBase. </li>
            <li class="li_1">If there is already a ClientBase Bill To or Ship To address, we do not replace it with the Sabre Profiles Billing or Delivery address. UNLESS the Bill To or Ship To are BLANK., This would mean if there is an address in ClientBase marked as Primary, Bill To, and Ship To, as is the default, it keeps all its designations. </li>
