        <p>If a Profile in ClientBase is found via a lookup method that does not use the UniqueID, the Profile is merged and logged to the changelog. </p>
        <p>If a matching ClientBase field is empty/null, and the Sabre Profile element has data, the ClientBase field is populated with the Sabre Profile Data.</p>
        <p><a name="_Toc17115993"></a><span class="Heading1Char_1">What </span><span class="Heading1Char_1">H</span><span class="Heading1Char_1">appens During Ongoing Sync?</span><span class="Heading1Char_1"><br /></span>After the initial sync in has completed, an ongoing sync process is begun to update and insert Profiles. The sync routine first looks to find the <span class="span_1">Sabre Profile ID </span>in ClientBase. This is a unique Sabre Profiles Profile number that has come over in the initial sync in process. </p>
        <p>In Sabre Profiles, what we would consider an "update" is actually the deletion of the old record and the addition of the new record. </p>
