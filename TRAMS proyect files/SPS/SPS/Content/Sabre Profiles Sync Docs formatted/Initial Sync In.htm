        <p>Before there can be ongoing synchronization between Sabre Profiles and ClientBase, an initial Sync In must be performed. This is a one-time import which brings Sabre Profiles into ClientBase by merging and inserting Profiles and Travelers. </p>
        <p>The initial import process finds all the Group, Traveler, and Corporate profiles in a given PCC. (Purged profiles are ignored.) It then makes a list of each of those profiles' Sabre Profile Index number (SPUniqueIDs) and sends that list to be processed as part of the ongoing sync to ClientBase. We first attempt to match Sabre Profiles with ClientBase Profiles and Travelers.</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If we can find a matching profile or traveler in ClientBase for a Sabre Profile, those records will be <span class="span_1">merged.</span> </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If no match can be found, the Sabre Profile or Traveler will be <span class="span_1">inserted</span>.</li>
