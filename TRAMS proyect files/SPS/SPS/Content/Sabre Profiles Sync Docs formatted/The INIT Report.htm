        <p>Before setting up for an initial (INIT) sync, you’ll want to make sure that your customer profiles in both Sabre Profiles and ClientBase are in good shape. That means making sure that duplicates have been cleaned up, that outdated profiles (for example, test profiles) are purged, and so on. To help you locate these profiles, we created the INIT report.  Essentially, we take your Sabre Profiles data and do a mock initial sync with your ClientBase Online data. Then we show on the report what would have happened if there had been an actual Initial Sync In. </p>
