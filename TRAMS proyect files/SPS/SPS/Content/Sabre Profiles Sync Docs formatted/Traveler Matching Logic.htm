        <p>We start by looking at the numbers we know to be unique for a given traveler: Known Traveler Number, Redress Number, and Passport Number (together with the issuing country). </p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If the Sabre Profiles traveler and the ClientBase traveler have the same Known Traveler Number, that is a unique number, so if they match, we merge the two together into one traveler. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If the Sabre Profiles traveler and the ClientBase traveler have the same Redress number, same reasoning as above. That is a unique number, so we merge the two travelers into one. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If the Sabre Profiles traveler and the ClientBase traveler have the same Passport number and the same issuing country, that is a unique match, so we merge the two travelers together.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If none of the above conditions are true, then we look at the Traveler names and birthdates. First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, and birth date must all match. <span class="span_3">Exception:</span> if one traveler has a middle name and the other does not, this can be considered a match if all the other criteria match. </p>
