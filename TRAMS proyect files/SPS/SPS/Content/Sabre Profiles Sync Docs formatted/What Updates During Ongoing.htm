            <br />All updates are dictated by the ChangeHistory of the Sabre profile obtained by the ProfileHistoryRQ. The match logic occurs with Addresses (GRP/CRP only), Emails, Phone, Loyalty Cards (TVL only), Passports, and Credit Cards. The most recent ChangeHistory with a match is used, and all older ChangeHistory items are ignored. </p>
