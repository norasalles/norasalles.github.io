        <p>When handling your credit card data, we follow strict data security standards set forth by the <span class="span_3">P</span>ayment <span class="span_3">C</span>ard <span class="span_3">I</span>ndustry (PCI). These standards are a part of the <span class="span_3">PCI D</span>ata <span class="span_3">S</span>ecurity <span class="span_3">S</span>tandards (PCI DSS) and any company that processes credit card payments is required to adhere to them<span class="span_3">.</span></p>
        <p>• Credit cards in Sabre Profiles are required to have a <span class="span_3">Payment Usage Type</span>. Sabre Profiles Sync will use “All” by default for all credit cards synced into Sabre Profiles from ClientBase. </p>
