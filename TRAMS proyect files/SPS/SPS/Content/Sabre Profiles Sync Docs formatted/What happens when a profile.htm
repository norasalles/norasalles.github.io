        <p>When a ClientBase profile is deleted, upon syncing the change to Sabre Profiles, it is marked for purge and set to delete in 24 hours. If the Sabre Profile is updated after the ClientBase profile is updated, but before the change syncs over to Sabre Profiles, then the Sabre Profile will not be purged, and the updates made will sync the Profile back to ClientBase as a new profile.&#160;</p>
        <p>When a Sabre Profiles profile is marked for deletion, it is not deleted in ClientBase. Instead, the corresponding ClientBase profile’s PCC and Sabre Profiles Index Number are cleared. The profile remains in ClientBase as a non-syncing profile. If a purged SP profile is then restored after the CB profile is deleted, it will sync back to CB as a new profile.</p>
