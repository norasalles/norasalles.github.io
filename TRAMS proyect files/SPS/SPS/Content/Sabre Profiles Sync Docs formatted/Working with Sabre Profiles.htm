        <p>Templates are a feature of Sabre Profiles that makes it easier to ensure that the correct fields are completed. They can be used to hide parts of the Sabre Profile that you don’t need, to make fields required, and more. </p>
        <p>We have created default templates for your use in Sabre Profiles. Corporate, Group, and Traveler profiles each have their own template. These templates expose the fields that are supported in Sabre Profiles Sync to ClientBase. </p>
        <p>When a profile or traveler is imported into Sabre Profiles from ClientBase, if it doesn’t already have a template associated with it, then the corresponding default ClientBase template is applied. </p>
        <p>If your agency already uses templates, or if you would prefer to create your own templates, that is perfectly fine. Your agency’s templates are still available to use when creating Sabre Profiles. We will only attach our default templates to those profiles that don’t already have one.</p>
