        <p class="p_2">To receive a commission check from a payment source that covers multiple vendors such as PayMode, Marriott Hotels, Hilton Hotels, etc.: </p>
        <p class="p_2">1. Enter the payment received information for the check as normal.</p>
        <p class="p_2">2. Change the <span class="span_1">Profile Type</span> to “Vendor”.</p>
        <p class="p_2">3. Change the <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> field on the Vendor Settings tab.</p>
        <p class="p_2">If only “Comm Track” bookings are needed to apply the check to, select <span class="span_1">Submit To</span>, “Comm Track”. If only “Supplier” bookings are desired to apply the check to, select <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> of “Supplier”. To see both “Comm Track” and “Supplier” bookings to apply the check to, select <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> of “All” on the Vendor Settings tab. This will close both Comm Track and Supplier bookings using the same check on a single payment.</p>
        <p class="p_2">4. Select <span class="span_1">A Group of Vendors</span> field on the Vendor Settings tab and enter the appropriate “Group” in the field (PayMode, MC, HILTON etc.) These vendor groups are created under <span>Utilities|Setup|Groups.</span></p>

        <p class="p_2"><span>Important: </span>Each single payment source - PayMode, Marriott Hotels, Hilton Hotels, etc. needs a vendor profile even if no invoices will be created under that profile. The profile is only used to reflect the centralized payments received from this single payment source.</p>
        <p class="p_2">6. Click <span class="span_1">Query</span> and close off the appropriate queried bookings, and save the payment as normal. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Note:</span> The same procedure would apply for receiving a single check paying for invoices under two or more <span class="span_1">Grouped</span> client profiles. Just enter client group name in the <span class="span_1">Group of Clients</span> field instead of vendor information.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Hint: </span>Notice the field <span class="span_1">Vendors by Interface ID</span>. This field searches for the first two characters of the Vendor Interface ID. This is an alternative time saver for finding multiple hotels in a single chain without having to link them all together using the <span class="span_1">Groups</span> field in each Vendor profile. For example, by entering HI in the <span class="span_1">Vendors by Interface ID</span> field, all vendors that have an interface ID beginning with HI will be displayed.</p>

        <p class="p_2"><span class="span_1">Automated Clearing House</span> (ACH) is a system set up by the Federal Reserve Banks in the United States for standardizing the transfer of electronic payments between banking institutions. This Payment Method can be used for handing off data from Trams Back Office to a Payment Distribution Service or the agency’s bank. (This is like a PayMode settlement using EFT, but in reverse.) Instead of the agency receiving a file to reconcile payments being received, the agency sends a file, so that expense payments or payments to a vendor can be made from the file by a bank or Payment Distribution Service. Using a Payment Method of <span class="span_1">ACH</span> acts like an <span class="span_1">EFT</span> payment and appears directly on the Check Register and on the Bank Reconciliation. Both Payments Received and Payments Made can be created, however only Payments Made can be exported to a file. <span class="span_1">The file output conforms to the NACHA format.</span></p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Payment Made</span> - The payment can be included in the ACH Export file sent to a bank or Payment Distribution Service for processing. These payments when processed by the agency’s bank or Payment Distribution Service would appear on the bank statement as an EFT payment and would be cleared when doing a Bank Reconciliation.</p>
        <p class="p_2">An ACH Payment Made could be used to electronically pay Vendors that would allow for an electronic payment to them, and to make expense payments for goods and services the agency purchases, like the electric or gas bill. </p>
        <p class="p_2">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 1 Welcome/Payments_5.jpg" style="height: 296px;width: 536px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p class="p_2">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Payment Received </span>- Not Currently Implemented. Create a payment received using ACH, but the payment cannot currently be included in the ACH Export file sent to a bank or Payment Distribution Service for processing. Therefore the amount of the payment would not show on any bank statement and could not be cleared when doing a Bank Reconciliation. When implemented, an ACH Payment Received could be used by an agency to collect fees from another entity, or for a larger agency chain to collect monthly licensing fees.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Profiles</span> - New fields have been added under <span class="span_1">Bank Account Settings</span>, on the <span class="span_1">Payment Info</span> tab of all profile types for <span class="span_1">Bank Account</span> and <span class="span_1">Routing No</span>. The <span class="span_1">Routing Number</span> field is composed of both the Bank Code and the Bank Branch. The first four (4) digits are for the Bank Code and the last five (5) digits are for the Bank Branch. In the US those two numbers are usually combined into one nine (9) digit Routing Number. In other countries the Bank Code and Bank Branch may be separate numbers. If so, enter both in the <span class="span_1">Routing Number</span> field with no spaces or dashes. Enter all nine (9) digits including any 'leading' zeros if present.</p>

        <p class="p_2">A voucher acts as a container for money received and held on account, or money sent to vendors for items not yet invoiced. This feature is particularly useful when selling group travel. (See <span class="span_1">Handling Groups</span> in TBO section of invoice chapter.) <span class="span_1">Voucher</span> is not a main menu option. Create a voucher by going to <span>Payments|Received</span> or <span>Payments|Made</span> and entering a payment that does not apply to an invoice.</p>
        <p class="p_2">If there are no open invoices for a client or vendor, when clicking on <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save the payment, a message will be received, <span class="span_1">Profile has no open invoices prior to payment date. </span>This presents three unapplied payment options: <span class="span_1">Create Voucher, Leave Unapplied, </span>and<span class="span_1"> Cancel. </span>The system does not allow closing vouchers or creating new vouchers on a credit card payment.</p>
        <h3><a name="No_Open_Invoices_Message_Create_Voucher" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>No Open Invoices Message/Create Voucher </h3>
        <p class="p_2"><span class="span_1">1. Create voucher</span> allows voucher creation. Click on <span class="span_1">Create Voucher</span> to enter a group name and add remarks. (When creating a client or vendor voucher, the branch entered into the Payment Screen defaults to the voucher screen, so the branch for the payment and the voucher are the same. If there is no branch entry on the Payment screen, then the default branch setup in <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults|Prompt Tab</span> is used when creating a voucher. A voucher cannot be saved without a branch entry.) Click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save. Vouchers reduce the Invoices Total due on the Client and Vendor Balances Summary Report. They show up as an invoice number followed by a “V” in the Client Balances or Vendor Balances Detail Report </p>
        <p class="p_2">Client vouchers also show on Client Statements. Vendor vouchers show on Vendor Statements. There will be a line item for each voucher created on a Client or Vendor account. They reduce the Vendors Total Open Balance to provide a net amount due from the agency. They reduce the client's Total Open Balance to provide a net amount due. </p>
        <p class="p_2">To close a voucher, enter a payment of the final balance due. Close any open invoices and vouchers that close this open balance. Click <span class="span_1">Close All</span> to close the vouchers and invoices on this accounts. This closes the balance on the Client Balances Report and the Client Statement or the Vendor Balance Report and the Vendor Statement. </p>
        <p class="p_2">Query for a voucher in the Invoice Query menu. Vouchers have the letter “V” after their number when searching for them in the invoice screen, or choose Invoice Type Voucher. </p>
        <p class="p_2">2. <span class="span_1">Leave unapplied</span> - Saves the payment without applying the payment to an invoice and without creating a voucher. <span>Note:</span> Unapplied balances appear as one lump sum on the reports, so there is not payment details. This is not recommended. The system does not allow an unapplied CC payment. The unapplied option can be turned off under <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults|Prompt.</span> Query for unapplied payment detail in the Payment Query menu. Select the <span class="span_1">Advanced Tab</span> and change the <span class="span_1">Only Unapplied</span> field to <span class="span_1">Yes</span>.</p>
        <p class="p_2">3. <span class="span_1">Cancel</span> - Goes back to the payment to make any changes, apply the payment to an invoice, or cancel the payment.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Note: </span>A confirmation number field in a vendor voucher allows users to enter confirmation numbers in the <span>Payments Received/Made|Global Settings</span> tab to find both the invoice and the voucher by confirmation number and close both.</p>
        <h3><a name="Track_Voucher_Payments_Allocated_Across_Multiple_Invoices" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Track Voucher Payments Allocated Across Multiple Invoices</h3>
        <p class="p_2">To track how voucher payments have been allocated across multiple invoices, follow the steps below.</p>
        <p class="p_2">1. Go to <span>Payments|Received</span> and create the voucher as usual. <span>Note:</span> To partially apply a voucher, consider creating a Payment Group for the original payment that created the Voucher and use that Payment Group for all subsequent partial payments for the voucher. Example: Voucher 142 would be the Payment Group name for the original payment that created Voucher 142 and is then added to all subsequent partial payments of Voucher 142.</p>
        <p class="p_2">2. To partially apply a voucher to close an existing invoice or invoices, create a <span>Payments|Received</span>. The Payment Amount is $0. The Payment Method is either Cash or Other. Close each of the sales invoices, but do not close the voucher. The amount of the sales invoices closed is in the Unapplied Balance area at bottom of screen. </p>
        <p class="p_2">3. Next, select the voucher, right-click, select <span class="span_1">Partial Payment</span>, and enter the amount of the unapplied balance (total amount of invoices closed) as a negative amount. Since the amount of the voucher is being reduced, the partial payment must be entered as a negative amount equal to the amount of the invoice(s) being closed. When saving the zero payment, do not create a Journal Entry. </p>
        <p class="p_2">4. This process of partially using the balance of a voucher to close more invoices can be repeated as needed. Only close the voucher when applying the final amount of the voucher against the final invoice. </p>
        <p class="p_2">5. To see the pay down of the original voucher, query for the voucher in the Invoice Query Screen, then right-click on the voucher, and select <span class="span_1">Query All Payments</span>, and print if desired. All payments are attached to the original voucher. To see the invoices paid by the voucher, right-mouse click on any payment and select Query All Invoices, and print if desired. </p>
        <p class="p_2">6. To close out multiple invoices attached to a single vouchers by multiple payments, run a Payment Analysis Report using the Payment Group assigned to the original Voucher and the Voucher Partial Payments, to see the complete history of the voucher from initial creation to final closing.</p>

        <p class="p_2">Credit card transactions are then processed and sent back to TBO, where the system clears the payments, and creates the journal entry to record the activity in the General Ledger. Setup needs to be completed before processing the payments. For complete setup instructions, go to the chapter <span class="span_1">Utilities</span> and the section <span class="span_1">CC Processors </span>print this document located <a href="http://static.trams.com/tramslibrary/documentation/ccmerchant/gettingstartedccmerchanttbo.pdf"><span class="Hyperlink">here</span></a>. </p>

        </p>
        <p class="p_2">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Bank Acct:</span> Select the bank account number the CC Merchant payments were created under.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Branch:</span> If processing items for a specific branch, select the appropriate branch number. Leave the field blank to process all branches.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Note:</span> Process multiple branches all at once as long as the CC Merchant fee is not being processed by branch (i.e. payments were entered under different management branches, but are all tied together under the same GL branch.) If the CC Merchant fee needs to be expensed by branch then process each branch separately.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>CC Processor:</span> Select the credit card processing vendor that is processing the cards.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Clearing Date:</span> The Clearing Date field defaults to the current date. This date is stamped into the CC Merchant payment record once the record is processed. Once a CC Merchant payment has a clearing date, it always shows a cleared status and therefore will not be selected for processing again. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Stmt Balance:</span> Leave this field blank. It is not needed for CC Merchant processing.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Max Charge Amt:</span> To process transactions up to and including a certain amount, enter the amount in this field.</p>
        <p class="p_21">Example: Agency has a certain employee that is responsible for processing service fee transactions only. Service fees for the agency are $20.00. The employee enters $20.00 as the Max Charge Amt so that only transactions of $20.00 or less appear in the query for processing.</p>
        <p class="p_2">After entering the appropriate selection criteria, click <span class="span_1">Query</span>.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Note: </span>UATP cards can be used for Pinnacle Payment Solutions. Add UATP as a new card if processed through Pinnacle, under <span>Utilities|Setup|CC Processors</span>. The UATP CC Merchant Payment is created the same as any other CC processed. When going to the CC Merchant Reconciliation Screen, select only UATP as the <span class="span_1">Included Card</span> and process those transactions, but the processor selected must be <span class="span_1">Pinnacle</span>. Both charges and refunds may be processed.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Note: </span>NTC CC Merchant Processing now allows users to send multiple batches within the same day without being rejected as duplicate submissions.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Step 2:</span> Trams displays the query results for the CC Merchant transactions that will be submitted for processing.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Step 3:</span> Click <span class="span_1">Process</span>. Select the option <span class="span_1">All Items</span> if processing everything in the query. Select the option <span class="span_1">Selected Items</span> if processing certain transactions only. Once a selection is chosen, the CC Merchant transactions are sent to the credit card processing vendor via the internet connection.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Note:</span> If processing <span class="span_1">Selected Items</span>, highlight those transactions prior to clicking <span class="span_1">Process</span>. Select multiple transactions by holding the Ctrl button and doing a right-mouse click.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Step 4:</span> Trams displays a status message box on the CC Merchant reconciliation screen that gives the user feedback about the charges currently being processed.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Step 5:</span> Once all cards are sent to the credit card processor, the status message box clears the screen. Each record processed shows as "Charged" in the column labeled "Status". Also, an authorization code, a decline code, or an error code appears in the column labeled "Auth Msg". If the record is approved, <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> updates the payment record with a "Date Cleared" of the date the transaction was processed. Once the "Date Cleared" is entered, those records will not be processed again. Records that are declined or are in error are not marked cleared. The "Date Cleared" field for those payment records is left blank. The decline code or error code, however, is appended to the remarks field of the payment record for future reference. </p>
        <p class="p_2">If the processor is Ticketmaster, updated descriptions for the decline codes and error codes are available on their web site at: <a href="https://www.iats.ticketmaster.com/english/help/rejects.html">https://www.iats.ticketmaster.com/english/help/rejects.html</a>. </p>
        <p class="p_2">If the processor is Pinnacle Payment Solutions, please call Merchant Services at 800 228-0210 and ask for customer support for the meaning of the code(s).</p>
        <p class="p_2">Click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to continue.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Step 6:</span> Trams prompts, "XX Payment(s) Will Be Marked Cleared and XX Will Be Marked Uncleared. Continue?" Click <span class="span_1">Yes</span>.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Step 7:</span> The payment screen is displayed to create the EFT payment for the amount being deposited into a bank account (card amounts processed less fees).</p>
        <p class="p_2">The payment screen defaults to a <span class="span_1">Payment Method</span> of EFT, <span class="span_1">Profile Type</span> of Other, and <span class="span_1">Name</span> as the name of the credit card processing vendor, based on the profile selected when setting up Utility defaults. Click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save the payment information. Trams prompts, "Create a journal entry?" Click Yes.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Step 8:</span> Trams defaults the journal entry as follows:</p>
        <p class="p_20">Cash in Bank (1000 series) Debit</p>
        <p class="p_20">CC Merchant Receivable (1000 series) Credit</p>
        <p class="p_20">Credit Card Processing Fees (6000 - 9000 series) Debit</p>
        <p class="p_20">Transaction Fees (6000 - 9000 series) Debit</p>

        <p class="p_2"><span>Global Modify</span> - Globally modify an agent’s Commission Rate Percentage % or amount to all bookings or bookings selected by travel type in the query screen, for a specific agent. This globally applied percentage can be used by agencies that are wanting to pay agents a base salary plus a commission bonus based on exceeding an identified commission 'threshold'. The <span class="span_1">Total Commission</span> field should be used as an aid to easily see whether an agent has exceeded the threshold and then calculate the percentage to be used for the Global Modify of the agent commission rate, without running an additional report.</p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Example: </span>Agent salary $1500.00 per month - Commission Revenue Threshold - 5000.00/month </p>
        <p class="p_2">Any Commission Revenue exceeding 5000.00/month is paid to the agent at 30% of the excess. Agent books 6000.00 of commission revenue exceeding the threshold by 1000.00 or 300.00 extra compensation to the agent.</p>
        <p class="p_2">Agent Total Compensation for the month = 1800.00 (1500.00 + 300.00)</p>
        <p class="p_2">Calculation of percentage to apply to all this agents bookings across the board for the month:</p>
        <p class="p_2">300.00 / 6000.00 = .05% (.05% X 6000.00 = 300.00 of extra commission revenue from all bookings during the month to be added to the base salary of 1500.00)</p>
        <p class="p_2">The Global Modify feature for agent commission percentage % would be 5% applied to all the booked commissions for the agent for the month and display as 5.00% in the 'Rate' Field for the agent on the Agent Tab of the Booking Screen. </p>
        <p class="p_2"><span>Note:</span> Agent Payments are linked to the Cleared Agent Bookings when using the Agent Reconciliation. If a query for the payment made to the agent is performed on the Payment Query Screen, right-click to <span class="span_1">Query All Invoices</span>, the invoices cleared and paid to the agent when using the Agent Reconciliation, are displayed.

        <p>The fields displayed in the top section show how an Operating Payable can be found. Each of these fields are fields within the Operating Payable and can be used to locate that Operating Payable again. As few as none and as many as all can be completed to retrieve an Operating Payable.</p>
        <p>Buttons on the right side of the screen are also broken into two sections. <span class="span_1">Query, Reset, Count, Sort by, Columns </span>and <span class="span_1">Default</span> are buttons related to the query. </p>
        <p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Use <span class="span_1">Reset</span> to clear away any previous query criteria. <span class="span_1">Count</span> is used to give the number of items that match the query criteria. <span class="span_1">Sort By</span> customizes how the query screen displays the results once the query is executed. </p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Columns</span> is used to select which columns of data to be display in the results screen. Click <span class="span_1">Columns</span> and choose the columns to display by highlighting the column in the <span class="span_1">Available Fields</span> and clicking on the left arrow to move it over to <span class="span_1">Displayed Fields</span>. </p>
        <p>Using the red up and down arrows, put the column in the order to appear on the results screen. Click <span class="span_1">OK. </span>Go out to the results screen and size the columns, and then back into <span class="span_1">Columns</span> and click <span class="span_1">Save Settings </span>and <span class="span_1">OK</span>. Click <span class="span_1">Sort</span> to get up to 3 sorts in ascending or descending order of selected columns, and click <span class="span_1">Save Settings</span>.</p>
        <p>Also drag and drop the columns to re-position them on the results screen if desired. Do this by clicking on the column to move, holding down the left mouse button, and sliding the column to any position on the query screen. </p>
        <p>To place a column to the right or left of any existing column, stop on the column to the right or left, drag and release the mouse. The moved column is inserted in the correct place. Click <span class="span_1">Columns,</span><span class="span_1">Save Settings,</span> and <span class="span_1">OK</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Default </span>saves the filters in the query. Follow these directions to create a new Saved Query:</p>
        <p>1. Change the selection criteria on the results screen for the new query to save.</p>
        <p>2. Click <span class="span_1">Default</span>.</p>
        <p>3. Type in the new query name in the <span class="span_1">Setting Name</span> field.</p>
        <p>4. If this saved query is the default, at the top of the drop-down window, check <span class="span_1">Set As Default</span>.</p>
        <p>5. Select <span class="span_1">Per User</span> (on this one workstation only) or Global (on everyone’s sets).</p>
        <p>6. Click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save.</p>
        <p>To remove a saved query from the list, check the <span class="span_1">Remove the Current Named Setting</span> box, click <span class="span_1">OK </span>and the saved query is no longer available for use in the drop down field. </p>
        <p>To the right of the Remarks field is a separate field with selection options or operators, <span class="span_1">Is Equal To, Is Not Equal To, Is Blank, Is Not Blank, Starting With, Contains, In, and Not In</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 1 Welcome/Note to Canadian Agencies_2.png" style="height: 115px;width: 119px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>These operators help to more narrowly define the search. (When doing searches on fields containing “wildcard” search criteria using the selections of “IN” and “NOT IN," look for the field to contain the complete string entered between the delimiters or the exact match). </p>
        <p>If the remarks field contains the word ONE, and a search is initiated for IN ONE,TWO,THREE then there should be a result. If a search is initiated for NOT IN ONE,TWO,THREE then there should be no results. Basically using IN "ONE,TWO,THREE" is like doing: (IS EQUAL TO "ONE") OR (IS EQUAL TO "TWO") OR (IS EQUAL TO "THREE"). Using NOT IN "ONE,TWO,THREE" is like doing: (IS NOT EQUAL TO "ONE") AND (IS NOT EQUAL TO "TWO") AND (IS NOT EQUAL TO "THREE"). </p>

        <p>Sort data in all query screens in two ways:</p>
        <p>1. “Quick” sort by one field by clicking on a column in the results screen. The first click sorts the column in ascending order (first to last or earlier date to more current date), and clicking on the same column a second time sorts in descending order (last to first or current date to earlier date). </p>
        <p>2. Sort in Ascending or Descending order by up to 3 columns.

        <p>Recurring payables need to be generated before issuing the checks. Many agencies like to generate their recurring payables on the first of every month for payment at a later date during that month. To do this:</p>
        <p>1. Click on the <span class="span_1">Operating Payables</span> tab at the bottom of the screen (or enter through the <span>Payments|Query|Operating Payables</span> menu). </p>
        <p>2. Select <span class="span_1">Query</span> and complete as many or as few of the selection criteria fields as desired. </p>
        <p>3. Highlight the payable to generate and click on the <span class="span_1">Generate</span> tab. </p>
        <p class="p_15">When it is time to issue the check:</p>
        <p>1. Click on the <span class="span_1">Operating Payables Query </span>tab at the bottom of the screen and bring the “to be paid” entries onto the screen. </p>
        <p>2. Highlight the entry to pay and click on the <span class="span_1">Issue Check</span> tab. The check now appears on the screen to modify fields such as amount and pay method. </p>
        <p>3. When satisfied with the data, click <span class="span_1">OK </span>to launch the check. </p>
        <p><strong class="bold_arial">Note: If payables are generated for the whole year, a new payable cannot be added without regenerating (duplicating) the original recurring payables.</strong> </p>

        <p>16. When the Total Open is 0.00, click the <span class="span_1">OK</span> button.</p>
        <p><span>Note:</span> If the agency has more than one ARC/BSP number, complete a separate ARC/BSP Settlement for <span class="italic_1">each</span>. The End-Of-Period routine automatically updates the GL Accounts for Cash in Bank and ARC/BSP Balances for all ARC/BSP Settlements for the period. Any invoices closed by an ARC/BSP Settlement have a Vendor Status of <span class="italic_1">Closed</span>. To make a change, void the ARC/BSP Settlement. The ARC/BSP Settlement creates a Payment Received or Made with a Payment method of EFT. (To void, see <span class="span_1">Void a Payment</span> in this chapter.)</p>
        <p><span>Reminder:</span> The ARC/BSP Sales Summary is printed from ARC/BSP's point of view. Remember that positive numbers in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> are negative numbers on the ARC/BSP Sales Summary. </p>
        <p>Before clicking <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save the <span class="span_1">closed</span> status once <span class="span_1">unapplied total</span> and <span class="span_1">total open </span>balance out to zero, click <span class="span_1">Print</span> and bring up the ARC Settlement report that should match the ARC/BSP Sales Summary. This speeds up reconciling the ARC/BSP report to the ARC/BSP Sales Summary to verify the ARC/BSP withdrawal/deposit, make adjustments, and resubmit tickets in one step.</p>

        <p>If the amount authorized for ARC/BSP was not enough (i.e. the ARC/BSP draft should have been $3000 but only $2800 was authorized), follow these steps.</p>
        <p>1. Select <span>Payment|ARC or BSP Settlement</span>.</p>

        <p>3. Enter a payment received for the $200 difference, with payment method as EFT and profile type as other. Date the payment the same date as the ARC/BSP Settlement. When prompted, create a journal entry as a debit to Cash in Bank and a credit to ARC/BSP Balances. This accounts for the incorrect amount that was entered when the ARC Settlement was done. This also creates a message on the GL Reconciliation report (Payment Invalid That Affects ARC Balances). Ignore this message. </p>

        <h3><a name="Z-Pay_PayWindow" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor202"></a>Z-Pay PayWindow</h3>
        <p>Trams Back Office (TBO) offers an import routine for customers using the Z-Pay PayWindow Payroll application. Users perform the payroll functions to calculate payroll information in PayWindow, then, by way of the export routine within PayWindow, can export the information to a text delimited file.</p>
        <p>Upon importing that file into TBO, the import routine creates a payment made with the corresponding journal entries for each payroll check for the applicable pay period that was entered in PayWindow. Check numbers can be generated in PayWindow and shipped via the export file to populate the check number in the TBO check number field, or check numbers can be assigned by TBO after the import routine is completed by issuing the check from within TBO.</p>
        <p>ACH direct deposit payroll payments can also be imported into TBO however, no check numbers apply so the check number field will be blank.</p>
        <p>Either Agent or Other profiles must exist in TBO with an Interface ID that matches the Employee ID in PayWindow. The file will not import if an Employee ID exists in the export file where no match in an Agent or Other interface ID field can be found during the import routine in TBO. The Employee ID field in PayWindow is alpha numeric and accepts up to 10 characters. <span class="span_3">Suggestion when setting up is to make the Employee ID match the Interface ID in TBO.</span></p>
        <p>Questions regarding exporting from PayWindow should be directed to Z-Pay (<a href="mailto:support@zpay.com">support@zpay.com</a>).</p>

        <p>The Payment Import feature provides the ability to import a file containing payment information and match the payments with invoices in TBO. Invoices that are paid by that provider can be modified if information differs between the imported file and the existing TBO bookings. Once the Payment Import process is completed, reconciled bookings will be closed with the payments from the file.</p>
        <p>The payment import feature can be used with the following providers. Please see the section <span class="span_1">Payment Import Provider Details</span> for specifics on how to sign up with these processors and obtain Trams-compatible import files.</p>

        <p><a name="kanchor209"></a>* Trams Host</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor210"></a>* Sabre Card Services </p>
        <p><a name="kanchor211"></a>* TACS -- Perot Systems</p>
        <p>The following are the fields in a TBO booking that can be modified using this feature:</p>
        <p>* Commission Amount</p>
        <p>* Agent Commission Amount (provided the agent has not been paid)</p>
        <p>* Gross Fare Amount</p>
        <p>* Vendor GST/QST</p>
        <p>* Vendor Remarks</p>
        <p>* Start Date/End Date</p>
        <p><span>Special Note:</span> Any Payment Import item (TACS, etc.) that has a total fare of zero in the file will not update the total fare to zero in TBO, although the commission amount will be updated to reflect the amount in the payment file.</p>
        <h3><a name="Payment_Import_Setup" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Payment/Import Setup</h3>
        <p>1. Create a vendor profile for the desired provider (Paymode, Onyx (formerly called Pegasus), CommTrak, Onyx II (formerly called Pegasus II), Trams Host, Sabre Card Services, and/or TACS - Perot Systems). This vendor profile will be the payee for the invoice created at the end of the payment import process. </p>
        <p>2. Go to <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults|Payment Import Options</span> to set up the secondary match default settings. These settings control how strict the match on secondary criteria must be for a booking to reconcile with the payment import file. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 1 Welcome/Note to Canadian Agencies_19.jpg" style="height: 363px;width: 425px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The primary match criteria are used before these secondary criteria come into effect. A booking must match both (1) Confirmation number AND (2) the Travel Category associated with the booking's Travel Type. </p>
        <p class="p_16">If no match is possible based on primary match criteria, the import process looks to the secondary criteria: </p>
        <p><span>* Passenger Name.</span> Use the setting Chars to Match on Passenger Name to determine how many characters must match. The default is 4 characters. A higher number will be more restrictive; a lower number, less so.</p>
        <p><span>* Depart Date.</span> Use the setting +/- Days from Actual Depart Date to control how closely the Depart Date in the payment file must match the Depart Date in the TBO booking. The default is +/- 3 days. A higher number will be less restrictive; a lower number, more so. </p>
        <p><span>* Vendor Name.</span> Use the setting Chars to Match on Vendor Name to determine how many characters must match. The default is 4 characters. A higher number will be more restrictive; a lower number, less so. </p>
        <p class="p_16">If a match is found using the three secondary criteria, an additional check takes place when the following settings are enabled (checked):</p>
        <p><span>* Match on Interface ID/Chain Code. </span>The Chain Code in the file must match the Interface ID of the Vendor Profile in the TBO Database. </p>
        <p><span>* Match on BSP/ARC Number.</span> The ARC or BSP number in the file must match the ARC or BSP number in the TBO database. </p>
        <p><span>* Match on City Code (if present).</span> The City Name in the import file must match the City Code in the TBO database. </p>
        <p class="p_16">The final setting controls what happens if the booking was cancelled or a no-show. </p>
        <p>*<span>Void Cancelled/No-Show Bookings.</span> When checked, if the payment import file reports that the booking was cancelled or a no-show, the corresponding booking is voided in TBO. Leave this option unchecked if you do not want these bookings voided. Note: Voided bookings will not be included in most reports.</p>

        <p>10. If there is an unmatched balance remaining (Onyx and Paymode service fees are considered unmatched balances), a prompt appears to create an invoice or voucher with the remaining balance. See below for more details on creating the invoice. </p>

        <p><span>D=</span> Multiple records in the payment import file match a single Trams Back Office booking. When saving the reconciliation, the commission amount applied to the booking is the sum of all the corresponding "D" and "R" items.

        <p>To receive the Trams-compatible payment import file, the agency needs to contact the company for enrollment. Files that may be obtained from a third party's website are: Paymode, Sabre Card Services, and WPS Hotel Commissions. Files that may be e-mailed to the agency are Onyx, Onyx II, and TACS. </p>
        <p>1. <span>Onyx</span> at <a href="http://www.comminfo.pegs.com/enrollment.asp"><span class="Hyperlink">http://www.comminfo.pegs.com/enrollment.asp</span></a> </p>

        <p>4. <span>WPS Network</span> - Address an e-mail to: <a href="mailto:%20dori@wpsnetwork.com"><span class="Hyperlink">dori@wpsnetwork.com</span></a> with Trams File in the subject line. Subsequent WPS uploads to the download area on the WPS website will be populated with the properly formatted .tsv file extension. </p>
        <p>5. <span>CommTrak</span> - CommTrak provides Hotel commission recovery services to travel agencies. Typically, an agency uses CommTrak to chase unpaid hotel commissions over 16 to 18 months old. These are commissions that have never been successfully obtained through the Onyx, TACS, or Paymode process. CommTrak splits the recovered commissions with the agency. Contact CommTrak Corp to set up an account - <a href="mailto:%20roger@commtrak.com"><span class="Hyperlink">Roger@CommTrak.com</span></a>. </p>
        <p>After establishing an account with CommTrak Corp, send CommTrak a data file (extract) containing aged, unresolved records. This CommTrak Export file is a Crystal Export and can be found at <a href="http://static.Trams.com/Tramslibrary/reports/index.html">http://static.Trams.com/Tramslibrary/reports/tbotcr.html</a>. (Click on TBO: Vendor Reports.) </p>
        <p>Download the "CommTrak Export" under "Vendor Reports" and save to the desktop. Run the export and forward the results to CommTrak. When CommTrak has reconciled the export sent to them, they forward a file back that can then be reconciled to the open Back Office Hotel bookings. </p>
        <p>6. <span>Onyx II </span>- This Onyx II fee-based option gives TBO customers another solution for reconciling hotel bookings with a Submit To of Comm Track. A file is exported from a TBO Database to Onyx II, using a TBO Crystal Export found at <a href="http://static.Trams.com/Tramslibrary/reports/tbotcr.html"><span class="Hyperlink">http://static.Trams.com/Tramslibrary/reports/tbotcr.html. </span></a>(Click on TBO: Vendor Reports.) </p>
        <p>Download the <span>Onyx II Export</span> report under Vendor Reports and save to the desktop. Run the export and forward the results to Onyx II. Onyx II performs the reconciliation on their servers. They then send the TBO user an externally reconciled file. The settled file returned to the Trams user is already matched and paid. This reconciled file can now be read by TBO as a Onyx II (formerly called Pegasus II) reconciliation and will close off the original TBO bookings that were exported to Onyx II for reconciliation. (The Back Office Export file sent to Onyx II contained the Trams Booking Number and that same Booking Number is also included in the returned file from Onyx II. There should be close to a 100% match on bookings.) </p>
        <p>Onyx II may include in its reconciled file bookings that were not in the TBO database at the time the export file was created sent to Onyx II. These bookings do not show as an "R" on the screen. Click off the Reconciliation Screen and manually add these non "R" bookings to TBO. Click back on the Reconciliation Screen and manually reconcile the added bookings by clicking the Reconcile. When finished reconciling all items, click <span class="span_1">OK</span>. </p>

        <p>The Sabre Card Services reconciliation option allows TBO users to daily close individual items in TBO that reconcile to the customer's Sabre Card Services' file by transaction, and to enter a payment for the daily Sabre Card Services deposit to the user's bank account. Monthly they will record an additional processing Sabre Card Services Fees. </p>
        <p><span>Notes:</span> </p>
        <p>1) All invoices should be entered for the vendor that is designated for capturing the service fee bookings in TBO. </p>
        <p>2) All Service Fee bookings MUST be Supplier in TBO. </p>
        <p>3) The client side of the Service Fee Bookings MUST be closed with FOP of CC (Not CC Merchant) </p>
        <p>4) Insure that the correct Travel Category of Service Fee is indicated for the Service Fee Travel Type being used in the TBO booking, under <span>Utilities|Setup|Travel Types</span>. </p>
        <p>5) In <span>General Ledger|Accounts</span>, set up a new 5000 series chart of account for Cost of Sales - Sabre Card Services or use an existing Cost of Sale account. In <span>General Ledger|Accounts</span>, set up a new Expense chart of account for Sabre Card Services CC Processing Fees or use an existing processing fee expense account. In <span>Utilities|Setup|Travel Types</span>, set up a new Travel Type for Sabre Card Services CC Processing Fees or use an existing fee travel type. Insure that the correct Travel Category of Service Fee is indicated. In <span>Utilities|Setup|GL Accounts</span>, link the Sabre Card Services CC Processing Fees Travel Type to the Cost of Sales - Sabre Card Services GL Account, so the EOP will correctly handle the processing fee invoice created when saving the Sabre Card Services reconciliation. </p>
        <p>6) Agency will contact Sabre Card Services and request <span class="span_1">Sabre Back Office</span> report be added to the agency's list of Merchant Reports. </p>
        <p>7) Refunds are not currently reconciled. Refunds do not reconcile because the client payment is closed to CC.</p>

        <p><span>Step 2)</span> The TBO user reconciles via the <span>Payments|Import Reconciliation</span> using the option that reads the Sabre Card Services file. TBO also reads the amount of Sabre Card Services fees that apply to the file and adjusts each booking by the amount of the fees involved. This insures that when agents are paid for any portion of the service fees, they are paid on only the net portion after processing fees that the agency actually received. Upon saving the Reconciliation an Invoice is created for the remaining amount of the processing fees to be charged by Sabre. </p>
        <p>Saving the reconciliation closes off the vendor side of the bookings, so nothing more needs to be done with the bookings. </p>
        <p>a. Open the Payment Import Reconciliation screen in TBO. </p>
        <p>b. Select Sabre Card Services as the Payment Source. </p>
        <p>c. Select Payee Name for the vendor profile. This may be the same as what is assigned on the client invoice. Payee Name chosen will be viewed on the Check Register and Bank Reconciliation. </p>
        <p>d. Select the Bank Acct the Sabre Card Services will be deposited into. </p>
        <p>e. Payment Date is when the gross charges for the file being reconciled will be deposited in the bank which is usually 8 business days from the date of the transaction. (Fees created and included in the daily file for June 9, 2012 would be deposited into the bank on June 17, 2012.) </p>
        <p>f. Select a Pay Method of EFT so the payment created on saving will appear on the Check Register and Bank Reconciliation. </p>
        <p>g. Click Import Filename and locate the file downloaded from the Sabre Card Services website. </p>
        <p>h. Click Import and reconcile the file. </p>
        <p>i. When reconciled, click OK to save the reconciliation. </p>
        <p>j. When prompted for creating an Invoice or Voucher for the left over amount of the fees charged, select Invoice. Enter a Client, usually the agency, and enter an Agent if desired. Select a Travel Type for the Sabre Card Services CC Processing Fees travel type created in <span>Utilities|Setup|Travel Types</span>. </p>

        <p>The Trams Host option to Payments/Onyx-PayMode Import is used by an IC (Independent Contractor) to reconcile the file received from the HOST agency for CC and Cash/Check Commissions due from the Host. The Reconciliation is for the Total Fare &amp; Total Comm from the Host bookings. A final Voucher may need to be created for any Transaction Fees that may be included.</p>

        <h2><a name="Payment_Query" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor215"></a>Payment Query</h2>
        <p><span class="span_1">Query </span>can retrieve an existing (or a previously entered) payment. Enter the query screen by either selecting <span>Payments|Query|Payments</span> from the main menu or using the Payment tab at the bottom of the screen. The query screen is broken into two sections. The top section is used to enter the data for the query and the bottom section displays the results of the query. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Chapter 1 Welcome/Invoice_5.jpg" style="height: 446px;width: 566px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The fields displayed in the top section show how a payment/s can be found. Each of these fields are fields within a payment to locate an existing payment. As few as none and as many as all can be completed to retrieve a payment. The more criteria entered in query, the more selective the search for matching payments. </p>
        <p>The most frequently used query fields show on the General tab and additional fields are found in the Advanced tab. Enter the criteria available (or applicable) and the system brings up a complete listing of payments matching that criteria. </p>
        <p>To the right of the <span class="span_1">Name</span> field is a separate field with selection options or operators: Is Equal To, Is Not Equal To, Is Blank, Is Not Blank, Starting With, Contains, In, and Not In. These operators help to more narrowly define the search. (When doing searches on fields containing “wildcard” search criteria using the selections of “IN” and “NOT IN," it is desired for the field to contain the complete string entered between the delimiters or the exact match). In other words, In and Not In works like Is Equal to or Is Not Equal to except that the list of values when using In and Not In when separated by a comma will search for each value in the list. The entire text would need to match exactly for Is Equal to or Is Not Equal to.</p>

If, in addition to the Payment Type, a range of Check Numbers is entered into the Query fields, the list is narrowed and only disbursements with Check Numbers matching your criteria are included. To select a specific Payment Type or Pay Method, click on an item to select (or de-select). That action places a checkmark next to the selected item. </p>

Make a Note of date; check number, etc.or print the payment if it is to be re-entered. A dialog box now appears that asks <span class="span_1">Track Voided Payment. </span>Click <span class="span_1">Yes </span>if this is a spoiled check that is needed to appear on the Bank Reconciliation, and click <span class="span_1">No</span> if there is no tracking because the payment is being re-entered<span class="span_1">. </span>If <span class="span_1">Always Track Voided Payments</span> is checked in <span class="span_1">Utilities|SetUp|Global Defaults|Prompt Tab, </span>there is no option track a payment<span class="span_1">.</span></p>
        <p>5. Click <span class="span_1">YES</span>.</p>
        <p><strong class="bold_arial">Note</strong>: When a payment is voided in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>, and <span class="span_1">No</span> to tracking is selected, There is no history of that payment the payment record is erased from the system. Voiding <span class="span_3">undoes</span> any effects of that payment, therefore, voiding a payment received reopens any invoices closed by that payment. </p>
        <p>Voiding a payment also removes any record of the transaction. Voided payments cannot be retrieved but can be reentered. To void a bank transaction, such as a check, and still be able to track the check, enter the amount as 0 and Note in the remarks that the item has been voided. For payments being voided but later re-entered, <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> recommends printing the payment by clicking <span class="span_1">Print Payment</span> before voiding the payment. </p>
        <p>Also void a payment from within an Invoice Query by highlighting a booking line. Look at the right-hand side of the screen. There is a prompt, <span class="span_1">Void Client Payment (or Void Vendor Payment)</span>. Select the payment to void and click on it. This voids the payment and opens the invoice for modification.</p>

        <h2><a name="Processing_TAFP_Service_Fees_-_ARC_Only" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor223"></a>Processing TAFP Service Fees - ARC Only</h2>
        <p>There is a TAFP service fee processing report for agencies who process their credit card service fees through ARC. The TAFP complies with ARC standards with the details of all service charges paid with a client credit card. </p>
        <p>The following is the suggested method of entering TAFP transactions into <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>:</p>
        <p>1. Create a Vendor profile called TAFP. (This can be done when entering the service fee booking by typing TAFP in the Non ARC Vendor field, or the profile can be created through the main Profiles menu.)</p>
        <p>2. When creating this profile, enter TAFP in the GROUP/BATCH field. <span class="span_1">This is important</span>.</p>
        <p>3. Create a 6000 series expense account called Credit Card Processing Fees. </p>
        <p class="p_12">Now:</p>
        <p>1. Enter a Supplier booking with a Travel Type of Svc Fee, the Non-ARC Vendor as TAFP and enter the document number in the Confirmation Number field. </p>
        <p>2. Enter the amount of the fee in the Total Fare field. </p>
        <p>3. Leave the Tax field blank and enter a commission amount equal to the net amount expected to be received from ARC (presumed to be 96.5% of the Total Fare).</p>
        <p>4. Close the supplier booking with a credit card payment. This creates a negative Vendor Balance for the vendor TAFP.</p>
        <p>5. At the end of the week run the TAFP report and submit to ARC for the previous Monday to Sunday dates. </p>
        <p>6. When processing this report, be sure the Vendor Group field reads TAFP.</p>
        <p>7. Please see Section entitled “Processing TAFP Service Fees” in th<span class="span_1">is</span> chapter for complete instructions.</p>
        <p>8. When money is received from ARC, enter a payment received with profile type of Vendor Supplier and a name of TAFP, and close the booking(s) to which it applies.</p>
        <p class="p_15">In certain cases: </p>
        <p>1. If, in the invoice commission field, there was entered the net amount less the fee ARC/BSP charges, close the booking. </p>
        <p>2. If a commission amount entered on the invoice equaled the total fare, close the booking and leave the balance unapplied. This is the 3.5% ARC/BSP fee.</p>
        <p>3. Enter a second payment received for this ARC/BSP fee amount, with a Pay Method of Other, Profile Type of Vendor/Supplier and Name of TAFP. </p>
        <p>4. This clears the unapplied balance. When prompted for the debit side of the journal entry, enter the 6000 series Credit Card Processing Fees expense account created in Step 3.</p>
