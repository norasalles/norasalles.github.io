        <h3><a name="Classes_of_Reports" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Classes of Reports</h3>
        <p>There are eight classes of pre-defined Report Generator reports that are included with <span class="trams">Trams Back Office</span>. These are listed below with their abbreviations. The abbreviations form the first part of each report name. </p>
        <p>Report names comprise the Report Class Abbreviation (AG {Agent}, BR {Branch}, etc.) combined with a "By Type" (Client, Vendor, etc.) abbreviation, and whether it is a "Summary" Report (AS) or a "Detail" Report (AD). Thus, the Client Activity Summary Report is called CL_AS. Below is a summary listing of the reports, with their names, and a brief description of the application of each.</p>
        <p>Print, modify, or build new reports. From the <span>Report Generator|Print Report </span>option, click the report name field or press <span class="span_1">Enter </span>to display a full list of available reports.</p>

        <h3><a name="Useful_Hints" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Useful Hints</h3>
        <p>1)The <span class="span_1">All ARC/Supplier, Closed CommTrack</span> parameter has been added to Report Generator/Print report as Date Range drop-down options. When selected, this option will return all bookings that have ([Submit To = ARC] or [Submit to = Supplier]or [Vendor Payment Status = Closed and Submit to = CommTrack]). The single date range entered when "All ARC/Supplier, Closed CommTrack" is selected queries two different date ranges: Issue date of the invoice for <span class="span_1">All ARC/Supplier and </span>Vendor Payment date for <span class="span_1">Closed CommTrack.</span></p>
        <p>2) Enter either a check number or credit card number in the <span class="span_1">CK/CC No </span>field to display only the invoices where the client paid with the entered number. If a credit card number was the form of payment, only items using that credit card number appear in the report. For example, the <span class="span_1">CK/CC No</span> field reads from left to right, so that entering a "4" queries all credit card numbers beginning with 4. This will produce a report for all invoices where the client used <span class="span_1">Visa</span> as the form of payment. </p>
        <p>Narrow the search by <span class="span_1">Payment Method</span> to display those items where the client has paid by that selected Payment Method. This field coupled with the <span class="span_1">Ck/CC No</span> field will run a report for all Invoices where the Client form of payment was by <span class="span_1">Credit Card</span> for either a specific credit card or for all credit cards beginning with a "4" (all <span class="span_1">Visa</span> transactions).</p>
        <p>3) <span>Multiple Forms of Payments</span> can be selected to view all credit card payments and CC Merchant payments on one report.</p>
        <p>4) <span>City &amp; Origin/Destination Fields: </span>Enter a city code in either field, but not both. The fields are used for filtering different city code data based on where the city code resides in the booking. <span class="span_1">City</span> field is reading the first <span class="span_1">Itinerary</span> field from the General Tab of the booking. All city codes appearing in the first <span class="span_1">Itinerary </span>field are displayed on the report, based on the other selection criteria, such as <span class="span_1">Issue Date, Depart Date, Travel Type</span>, etc. The <span class="span_1">City</span> field in Report Generator displays ARC, Supplier or Comm Track bookings on the report. Segment level booking details don’t have to be present for bookings to show on the report.</p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Origin/Destination</span> fields are reading the <span class="span_1">Origin</span> or <span class="span_1">Destination</span> fields from the Segment Tab of the booking, so if a booking does not have any segment level detail in the tab, like for hotels and cars, they would not appear on the report since the Segment Tab is blank for those type of bookings. </p>
        <p>5) <span>Exclude the clients that do not belong to other specific groups:</span> Under Advanced tab, select<span class="span_1"> Not In</span> and entered the Invoice Group IDs separated by a comma no spaces.</p>
        <p>6) <span>New filter parameter</span> has been added to the report generator print report screen in the advanced tab.&#160; It is <span class="span_1">Exclude Refund/Exchange/Dupe tickets</span>. Selecting this option emulates the logic used in the Invoice/City Pair report. Recommendation is to clean up duplicate tickets so those tickets will be included on the report as well.</p>

        <h2><a name="Summary_Listing_of_Reports_-_Agent_Reports" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor277"></a>Summary Listing of Reports - Agent Reports</h2>
        <p>This section lists all the predesigned agent reports installed with the program, and includes a description of each. Please see next chapter, <span class="span_1">Building Reports Using the Report Generator Overview, </span>to learn how to modify any of the following reports.</p>
        <h3><a name="Agent_Activity_Summary_(AG_AS)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Agent Activity Summary (AG_AS)</h3>

        <p>This report may helps plan for client meetings. If an agent is spending more time with one customer than another, it may be beneficial for the agent to attend future face-to-face meetings. Or, if an agent is spending too much time with one client, make changes to correct any imbalance. For each Agent and Client, this report summarizes the Number of Bookings, Total Fare, Commission, and Agent Commission only. </p>
        <h3><a name="Agent_Activity_by_Departure_Date_(AG_DD_AS)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Agent Activity by Departure Date (AG_DD_AS)</h3>
        <p>For each Agent and Departure Date, this report summarizes Number of Bookings, Total Fare, Commission, and Agent Commission. </p>
        <h3><a name="Agent_Activity_by_Departure_Point_(AG_DP_AS)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Agent Activity by Departure Point (AG_DP_AS)</h3>
        <p>For each Agent and Departure Point, this report summarizes Number of Bookings, Total Invoices, Commission, and Agent Commission. </p>
        <h3><a name="Agent_Final_Payment_(AG_PAY_D)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Agent Final Payment (AG_PAY_D)</h3>
        <p>Use the Final Pay Date <span class="span_1">From</span> and <span class="span_1">To</span> fields to narrow the criteria and view only those final payments due this week, or this month. For this report to work properly, agents must be completing the Final Payment Info box found in the invoice booking screen under the &lt;Exp Fare Info&gt; field. For each Agent and Invoice, this report lists Vendor, Pay Amount, and Pay Commission. Select <span class="span_1">Date Range</span> and change <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> field to <span class="span_1">Supplier</span> for final payment due date report by agent.</p>
        <h3><a name="Agent_Activity_by_Travel_Type_(AG_TT_AS)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Agent Activity by Travel Type (AG_TT_AS)</h3>
        <p>For each Agent and Travel Type, this report lists the Number of Bookings, the Total Fare, Commission, and Agent Commission. Use as a management report to analyze agent productivity and product mix. </p>
        <h3><a name="Agent_Activity_by_Vendor_(AG_VN_AS)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Agent Activity by Vendor (AG_VN_AS)</h3>
        <p>For each Agent and Vendor, this report lists the Number of Bookings, the Total Fare, Commission, and Agent Commission. Select the <span class="span_1">Date Range</span> and change the <span class="span_1">Preferred</span> field for a report of agent activity by preferred or non-preferred vendor. </p>
        <h2><a name="Summary_of_Airline_Reports" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor278"></a>Summary of Airline Reports</h2>
        <p>This section lists all the predesigned airline reports installed with the program, and includes a description of each.</p>
        <h3><a name="Airline_Commission_Report_(AIR_COM)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Airline Commission Report (AIR_COM)</h3>
        <p>Detailed listing of ARC transactions by Airline, including Base Fare, Commission, Issue Date, Itinerary, and number of bookings for each airline. </p>
        <p><strong class="bold_ariel">TIP:</strong> Run the AIR_COM (Commission Cap) report in the Report Generator for all ARC bookings with TT of Air, Domestic/International set to domestic, and Fare Type=Commision. The minimum should be one cent and the maximum should be 49.99. The results of this report show the domestic fares that were <span class="span_1">not</span> capped and received 10% commission. Multiply the commission amount by 20%. This equals the commission that would be lost at an 8% rate. </p>
        <p>Run the same report with Domestic/International set to International and the minimum set to one cent and the maximum commission left blank. Reduce this by 20 %. This gives the agency a “ballpark/worst case” scenario since some carriers have not reduced their commission percentage and some have not capped International commissions. If the agency has special agreements with certain airlines, enter the name of the airline into the vendor field and the terms of the agreement into the appropriate fields to get the commissions report for a specific airline.</p>

        <h3><a name="Airline_Activity_Detail_(AL_AD)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Airline Activity Detail (AL_AD)</h3>
        <p>This Airline Activity report is similar to the Airline Activity Summary, above, but gives a detailed listing of activities by airline. Change the <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> field to ARC/BSP and <span class="span_1">Travel Type</span> to Air.</p>
        <h3><a name="Airline_Activity_Summary_(AL_AS)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Airline Activity Summary (AL_AS)</h3>
        <p>The Airline Activity Summary report summarizes sales report by Airline.
