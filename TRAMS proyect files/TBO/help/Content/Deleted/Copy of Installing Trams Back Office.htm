        <p>A new auto-update feature has been added starting in Trams Back Office 3.06.00 that will automatically install updates for the tramswin and download executables. Auto-update greatly streamlines installing updates on users' workstations and ensure fixes are being installed in a timely manner. It will only install updates that match the current major version (3.06.01 or 3.06.02, for example). </p>
        <p>When Trams Back Office (tramswin.exe) is launched, the auto-update feature will check to see if a newer version is available, then automatically download and install the update on the users' workstation. The automatic update works for tramswin, download, ibbackup, and the ibbackuplib files. The earlier versions of the executables will be renamed by appending .old to the file name during the process, so they will still be available for rollback purposes if necessary.</p>
        <p>Users can cancel the auto-install routine and will be reminded 24 hours later upon the next login attempt. If a user does not have administrative rights, the auto-update routine won't be able to install the new versions. If download.exe is running while the update is being installed, it won't be interrupted. The download.exe file will be renamed to download.exe.old while running, and the next time download.exe is launched, the new version will run.</p>

        <p>The <span class="span_1">Trams</span> License Manager utilizes for communication Port 8090. This port must be opened on any firewall that a company may be utilizing to filter traffic internally. It also must be opened externally, for remote users, in their network configuration.</p>

        <h3><a name="Backgrou"></a>Background</h3>
        <p class="p_14">The payment card industry (PCI) compliance and validation regulations spell out what security measures must be taken to protect the private information during any transaction occurring with the use of a paycard. The PCI Data Security Standard is used by all card brands to assure the security of the data gathered when transacting on behalf of a customer. There are numerous regulations, including encrypting the credit card numbers in the database. Encrypting this data makes it virtually impossible to decipher a credit card number without a decryption key which protects the credit card information in your database from fraudulent abuse. Future Trams Back Office development will implement additional enhancements to help agencies further comply with the PCI regulations.</p>
        <h3><a name="How"></a>How it Works</h3>
        <p><span class="span_6">In Trams Back Office, credit card numbers are encrypted in the database and masked throughout most of the Trams applications. A field exists in the database to accommodate the encrypted credit card number, and another field</span><span class="span_6">contains a masked version of the number. During encryption, a cleaning and masking routine takes place to standardize all of the credit card numbers so they can be properly masked for all applications utilizing the masked Credit card field. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_14">An indicator will show if the database has been encrypted and can be found under Help | Table Version Encrypted: (Yes/No).</p>

        <p class="p_14" MadCap:conditions="Default.Review" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">The field name Credit Card Number will be renamed “CCNUMBER”.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_14">Two changes to database fields take place when encryption takes place:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">

        <h3><a name="Use"></a>Use of <MadCap:keyword term="Encryption Keys" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" />Encryption Keys</h3>
        <p><span class="span_6">A unique encryption key will be generated for each agency that can be used in product development for applications that will need to read the full credit card number. The key can be obtained by a SYSDBA log-in only by going to Utilities | Credit Card Encryption Key and entering a password provided by the Trams Support desk (Trams.TBOsupport@sabre.com). A CCEncrypt.dll file is installed that allows access </span><span class="span_6">to</span><span class="span_6">the Trams database to view un-encrypted Credit card numbers. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span_6">For the purpose of rotating an encryption key, version 117 or higher of the DBUP.exe can be used (with the additional command line parameter –REENCRYPT, will allow for credit card numbers to be re-encrypted so that a new encryption key may be generated. This feature is only available for </span><span class="span_7">non-syncing</span><span class="span_6"> databases.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_14">The intended audience is for the designers and developers of applications that reads credit card numbers in the Trams database from outside of the Trams applications.</p>
        <p><span class="span_6">A PCI requirement mandates logging when a full credit card number has been viewed. Therefore, functionality was added to allow users to view a full credit card number provided the user is logged in as SYSDBA or the user profile has the permission to view full credit card numbers enabled. Once enabled in payments received and made, in the profile payment info tab and in the booking expanded fare tab CC Commtrack field, </span><span class="span_8">right clicking on the credit card number field displays a menu option to view the full</span><span class="span_8">credit card number.</span><span class="span_6">When the user selects it, the full credit card number is displayed in the payment field and a log event is created including:</span>

The permission "Enable ability to view full credit card numbers can be found under Utilities/Setup/User Profiles under the Permissions tab and is unchecked for all users by default. </p>
        <p class="p_14">Credit card numbers are masked upon saving to the database. Users who have this permission enabled can right-click to view the full credit card number and select Show Full Credit Card numbers in the following areas:</p>

        <p>To EUA enable the database<span class="span_10">,</span> a special command line prompt must be used:&#160; dbup.exe -eua &#160;When the command line prompt is used, if the above requirements are not met<span class="span_10">,</span> the user is prompted, <span class="span_1">The following requirements must be met to EUA enable the database:</span></p>
        <p class="p_16">- Database Server version must be upgraded to version “10” or greater. The current version is “X”.</p>
        <p class="p_16">- Database File version must be upgraded to version “15” or greater. The current version is “X”</p>
        <p class="p_16">- Database Client version must be upgraded to version “10” or greater. The current version is “X”</p>
        <p class="p_16">Please verify these requirements are met and try EUA enabling again.</p>
        <p>If the requirements for EUA enabling the database are met the user is prompted,&#160;<span class="span_1">You have the option of using Embedded User Authentication. Your user logins and passwords will now be directly tied to your database file. Enable EUA?</span></p>
        <p>-&#160;<span>Help|About</span>&#160;includes a new entry:&#160;<span class="span_1">EUA Enabled Yes|No</span></p>
        <p>Upon EUA enabling a database all User Login passwords are converted and stored within the database, rather than within InterBase. The SYSDBA password remains unchanged. Upon logging into&#160;<span class="span_1">Trams</span>&#160;Back Office as SYSDBA after EUA enabling the database, continue using the original SYSDBA password. If that password was never changed from the generic "xxxxxxxxx" password, a prompt launches upon first login to change the password.</p>
        <p>All other User Logins have their current password converted to their login name (which is always Upper Case). As each user first logs into&#160;<span class="span_1">Trams</span>&#160;Back Office (or ClientBase) they will need to use their newly converted password based on their login name. For example, if the User Login name is MARY, upon first logging into&#160;<span class="span_1">Trams</span>&#160;Back Office the user should enter MARY into the Login Name&#160;<span>AND</span>&#160;enter MARY into the password. Upon successfully entering the User Login and Password the user is then prompted to enter a new password, to ensure security going forward. This new password is then used each time the user logs into&#160;<span class="span_1">Trams</span>&#160;Back Office. Because the database is EUA enabled, all users can now update their own User Login passwords by going to&#160;<span>Utilities|Setup|User Profile</span>&#160;and entering a new password.</p>
        <p>A new tab was added to <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults</span> called <span class="span_1">User Login Options</span> that is accessible for SYSDBA and Admin users with fields to set password expiration and password strengths.</p>
        <p class="p_15">PASSWORD EXPIRATION</p>
        <p>Enter the number of days until password is expired (Example: 30, 60, 90, etc.). If you are also a CBO user, the maximum time allowed for a password to be used before resetting is 90 days. Once password expires, when user tries to login user is directed to a new page and asked to enter the old password and a new password.</p>
        <p class="p_17">Password Strength</p>
        <p class="p_13">A setting was also added to assign password strength when creating a new password. If a chosen password does not meet the rules, user must change password before allowed to continue. </p>

        <p class="p_13">For security purposes certain passwords are no longer allowed to be used in the database. The default that came with the program is no longer allowed for use as a password for SYSDBA. After EUA enabling the database, if the SYSDBA password is the default, or if at any point you are changing the SYSDBA password and you try to use the default, you are prompted to select a different password.</p>
        <p class="p_13">For user logins, the user login name and the user password can no longer be the same. After EUA enabling the database, if you try to create a password that matches the user login name, you are prompted to select a different password. </p>
