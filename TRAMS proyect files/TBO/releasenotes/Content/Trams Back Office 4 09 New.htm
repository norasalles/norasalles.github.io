                <p class="p_4">For increased security and to move toward better compliance with PCI standards, the SYSDBA login now has restricted abilities. It can access the Help menu, access the File menu, reset its own password, and create users&#160;with Manager Authorization under Utilities | Setup | User Logins.&#160;In order to perform other managerial functions, your agency will need to have a user with the Authorization level of Manager. </p>

            <li class="ListParagraph_2">
                <p class="p_4">Except for Database Backup, which requires SYSDBA, a Manager user can do all the things that SYSDBA could do previously. Some functions, for example, creating or modifying user logins, will prompt the Manager to enter the SYSDBA password before allowing them to proceed. However, they are still logged in under their own user login.</p>

                <p class="p_4">We recommend that each person who uses Trams Back Office has a login with their own name, and that nobody shares a login. It is important that you be able to tell who has accessed the database and made changes.&#160;</p>

                <p class="p_4">When creating new User Logins, be sure to review the Menu Items and Permissions tab options and a adjust them according to the tasks the User will be performing. If the User will be downloading and processing interface records, they will need both the “View Full Credit Card Numbers” and “Run Reports/Export with full Credit Card Numbers and view REC LOC content” permissions enabled. </p>

There is no longer a prompt to save each Mail Merge report separately. From that preview, it is now possible to save multiple reports to a folder, again without being prompted to save each report separately. When multiple reports are selected, clicking Save will prompt you for a folder location to save the selected reports. You can select an existing folder or create a new folder.&#160; Any reports in Mail Merge format will be saved as text; any reports in Report format will be saved as PDF.&#160; The files will be saved using the Report Description (as seen on the Batch Report screen) for the file name. If a file with the same name already exists in the folder, the new report will be saved with a number at the end of its name so as not to overwrite the existing report.<br /></span>
