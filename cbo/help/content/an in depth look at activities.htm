            <p class="p_1">This chapter demonstrates how to use Reminders, Notes, and Mailers to increase agent productivity and enhance customer relationships. </p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Introduction_..40" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>One of the most difficult challenges today's travel agency faces is how to keep current clients loyal and develop long-time relationships with new customers. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> is designed to help agencies achieve these goals by tracking all types of client contacts in a well-organized manner by creating an electronic history. In addition, users can easily setup follow up reminders, note specific interactions - such as a phone call or Email received from a client, and track all correspondence associated with a specific profile. This chapter shows you how easy this is to do.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Overview_of_Activities_Types" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor75"></a>Overview of Activities Types </h2>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Notes" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor76"></a>Notes</h3>
            <p>Each time a contact is made by the agency with your customer, valuable information is received. These contacts should be documented in the form of a <span class="span_2">Note</span>. A <span class="span_2">Note</span> in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> is contained within a client profile and is similar to a “post-it note,” complete with date of contact, User Login and remarks. </p>
            <p class="p_2">A profile can have any number of Notes attached to it. This allows any agent interacting with the customer to view all past contacts. For example, Clara Adam’s calls the agency saying she’ll be a day or two late with her final deposit. Sharon creates a note, documenting the call. Not only is Clara’s Note “filed” in her profile in the Activities link, but it can be used, along with other Notes, to run reports.</p>
            <p class="p_3"><span class="span_3">Notes can be created from different areas in ClientBase:</span> </p>
            <p><span>- </span>Create a Note in the Profile Manager by clicking the action gear next to the selected profile.</p>

            </p>
            <p>- Create a Note by clicking on <span class="span_2">Note</span> menu bar everywhere in the program. Make sure to associate the Note with a profile by clicking the 3 dots next to that field if it is not already associated with the correct profile.</p>

            <p>Sharon, an agent, creates a <span class="span_2">Reminder</span> to call Ken Able next week to do a trip inquiry follow-up. Jean, another agent, creates a <span class="span_2">Reminder</span> to check on documents for Hank Adams. Mary, yet another agent, creates a <span class="span_2">Reminder</span> to welcome the Andersons home from their Hawaii honeymoon. Reminders allow you to schedule future tasks. As with Notes, Reminders are created and attached to a Client Profile. Any profile can have any number of Reminders attached to it.

            <p><span>Set Alarm: </span>To further assist with remembering important tasks, reminders include an optional alarm. This alarm, like the alarm which awakens you each morning, activates at the time designated within the reminder (regardless of where you are in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> program, or any other program) as long as <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> is running on your PC. </p>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Yes</span> and a list of active alarms appears. Choose the desired Reminder and click <span class="span_2">Edit</span> to view the details. Alarms can be set for Reminders only when To Do (Timeless) is not checked. This alarm activates at the time designated within the reminder as long as <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> is running. When an alarm is activated, user is prompted, “You have active alarms. Select Yes to view, or No to ignore.” When Yes is selected, there are three options to choose from: </p>
            <p>1) <span class="span_5">Off:</span> Turns off the alarm but keeps the reminder open and on to-do list. </p>
            <p>2) <span class="span_5">Snooze:</span> Reschedules the alarm for a future time. </p>
            <p>3) <span class="span_5">View:</span> Allows you to work the reminder as you would from the Activity Manager.</p>
            <p>Alarms can be set for single Reminders as well as Batched Reminders. When creating a single reminder enter the Start Time of the Reminder, click the “Set Alarm” checkbox and then select the time the alarm should activate prior to the Start Time. To create alarms for Batched Reminders, select <span>Tools|Settings|Batched Reminders</span>. When adding a new batch or editing an existing batch, once the Batched Reminder setup screen is displayed, enter the Start Time of the Reminder, click the “Set Alarm” checkbox and in the Duration select the time the alarm should activate prior to the Start Time. </p>
            <p><span>Update E-mail Calendar after Saving Changes: </span>When checked updates are sent to user’s e-mail address. This box is checked by default when the setting from User Settings is "All Reminders" or "Only for Reminders when time is set" (see below.)</p>
            <p>Upon saving the Reminder, an email is sent to the user. The e-mail appears as a meeting request and includes a link to the Activity. Click the Accept button to save the Reminder to the Outlook calendar.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Setup this Option: </span><span class="span_2">Automatically Update Email Calendar for Uncompleted Reminders</span>, was added to <span>Tools|Settings|User Logins</span> under the User Settings tab for each user. Select a setting for the field.</p>
            <p>• <span>Never </span>- Reminders are never sent to the Outlook calendar</p>
            <p>• <span>All Reminders</span> - All Open Reminders are sent to the Outlook calendar</p>
            <p>• <span>Only Reminders set for a Time</span> - Only Open Reminders with a selected Start Time are sent to the Outlook calendar</p>
            <p>• <span>Only Reminders set with an Alarm</span> - Only Open Reminders with the Set Alarm Box checked are sent to the Outlook calendar</p>
            <p>The user’s e-mail address is used for sending Reminders to the Outlook Calendar. If the user does not have an e-mail address entered in the User Settings, <span class="span_2">Never</span> is the only setting that can be entered for this field.</p>
            <p class="p_6">REMINDER</p>
            <p><span>Reminder Type: </span>Enter the type of follow-up for the Reminder by clicking on the drop-down menu and picking from a customized list. Such types may include phone call, Email, letter, etc. Reminder types are customized and setup in Global Defaults by the database administrator in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Priority: </span>Click on the drop-down menu to mark this Reminder with a priority level:<span class="span_2"> High, Medium, </span>or <span class="span_2">Low</span>. Priority level can be used as search criteria in both Level 2 Queries of the Activity Manager. All contact results viewed in both the Activity Manager are listed in order by date, then time, then priority level, starting from High to Medium to Low.</p>
            <p><span>Private: </span>Click here if you want the note to be private (not suggested). Only the sign-in agent and database administrator can access the Reminder.</p>
            <p><span>Subject: </span>Enter the subject of the Reminder by clicking the drop-down menu and picking from a customized list. </p>
            <p><span>Remarks:</span> Enter any additional remarks or instructions in the text box at the bottom of the Reminder entry screen. This is a very important section - this area will contain a history for everyone of what happened with this particular reminder.</p>
            <p><span>Save/Cancel</span>: Click <span class="span_2">Save</span> to accept new information, or <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> leave area without saving changes. </p>
            <p><span>Note</span>: Reminder and Alarm times throughout the program display times based on the local time and stored in the database in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). This allows users that are in different time zones but using the same database to always see the Reminder Activities and Alarms in their own local time. For example, if a user in Los Angeles creates a Reminder for 11 am, a user in Dallas will see it as 1 pm. Your Windows regional settings are used to display Reminders in your local time zone. </p>

            <p>Based on alarm settings selected in the reminder, a reminder alarm will be launched as specified.&#160; If more than one alarm is set to go off at the same time, all alarms will be displayed in a single popup screen.&#160; Multiple alarms can be selected and snoozed or dismissed concurrently.</p>
