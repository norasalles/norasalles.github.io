            <p class="p_1">This chapter familiarizes you with setting up, maintaining and using client profiles.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Introduction_..46" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's marketplace travel agencies are finding a need to shift their focus away from being order takers and processing transactions. To survive and profit, it has become imperative for an agency to practice CRM or <span class="span_2">Customer Relationship Management</span>. An agency services clients and strengthen these relationships in order to build and retain client loyalty. The information collected within the leisure and corporate profiles provide an important tool to achieve this goal.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Types_of_Client_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Types of Client Profiles</h2>
            <p>There are two types of client profiles in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> - Leisure and Corporate. A Leisure profile is created for each leisure client’s household. A client profile holds any number of travelers. For example, an agency created an leisure profile for Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Smith. The travelers are John, the primary contact; Karen, his wife; James, his son; and Jesse, his daughter, and are included as part of the Smith profile under the link, <span class="span_2">Traveler</span>. Whenever anyone in the household calls the agency to travel, John’s profile is accessed and used to confirm or add vital information for any traveler. </p>
            <p>Corporate profiles are created for each of your commercial clients. Each profile may contain any number of contact who are company travelers. These are listed in the client profile under the <span class="span_2">Contact</span> link. Many times a traveler listed under a corporate profile also is also a traveler in a leisure profile as well. A traveler can be linked to unlimited profiles types.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Create_a_New_Client_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor65"></a>Create a New Client Profile</h2>
            <p>New client profiles can be created by clicking on <span class="span_2">Create Profile </span>on the menu bar and selecting <span class="span_2">Leisure</span> or <span class="span_2">Corporate. </span></p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 an in-depth look at client profiles/an in depth look at client.png" style="height: 172px;width: 207px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p class="p_2">Want a quick way to create a profile? Use the following hot keys:</p>
            <p class="p_2">Alt shift L = New Leisure</p>
            <p class="p_2">Alt shift C = New Corporate</p>
            <p class="p_2">Alt shift S = New Service Provider</p>
            <p class="p_2">Alt shift V = New Vendor</p>
            <p class="p_2">Alt shift A = New Agent</p>
            <p class="p_2">Alt shift O = New Other</p>
            <p>After clicking <span class="span_2">Create Profile</span>, you can enter information on a new leisure client on the <span class="span_2">Quick Entry</span> form. There is one profile per paying party. The Quick Entry form consists of two screens, one for the Profile and one for the Primary Traveler. All Required and Optional fields are displayed, along with the basics: <span class="span_2">Profile Type, Name /Address Courtesy Title Primary Traveler fields, Primary Phone, Interface ID, Primary Agent, and Branch</span>. Required and optional fields are indicated with peach and green shading, respectively.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>On the Primary Traveler screen, after a user fills in the fields and clicks <span class="span_2">Save</span>, a search is performed behind the scenes based on the name fields and the phone and email fields. If a match is found, the user is prompted with a list of the matching Travelers and is given the opportunity to either link the existing Traveler to the new Profile, or to cancel out and create a new Traveler. </p>

            </p>
            <p>If a user does not have permission to access a certain profile type, they will be unable to create profiles of that type. If a user has no permission to view a profile tab which has required fields for a certain profile type, the user will not be able to create a profile of that type. </p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Anatomy_of_a_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Anatomy of a Profile</h2>
            <p>A client profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> stores an unlimited amount of information about your customers. To organize all this information and make it easily accessible to all users, each profile is made up of these key areas,<span class="span_2"> Menu Items, Header Info, Indicator Icons, </span>and<span class="span_2"> Information Links.</span></p>

            <p><span class="span_2">Merge To Document </span>enables you to launch a Document Template from the results of a query into Wordpad, MS Word, Open Office, etc. to view, edit and print the document with all fields merged. <span class="span_2">Merge To Email </span>launches an email message for the profile you are in. <span class="span_2">Merge To Label</span> enables you to create a label for this profile. </p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="CREATE_NEW_PNR" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>CREATE NEW PNR </h4>
            <p><span class="span_2">PNR (Merge to PNR) </span>enables you to pass client data to your reservation system's PNR. </p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="CREATE_NEW_RES_CARD" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>CREATE NEW RES CARD</h4>
            <p><span class="span_2">Res Card (Create a New Res Card)</span> activates the Res Card feature to enter trip data. </p>

            <p><span class="span_2">Live Connect (Merge to Live Connect) </span>activates a <span class="span_2">Live Connect</span> screen to enter your Vendor and Live Connect Provider and launches you into the Live Connect booking site without having to create a new Res Card first. Upon importing the reservation, a brand new Res Card with all the imported data therein is created.</p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="CREATE_NEW_NOTE_MAILER_REMINDER" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>CREATE NEW NOTE/MAILER/REMINDER</h4>
            <p>You can also create a <span class="span_2">Note, Mailer, or Reminder </span>from the menu bar for the profile you are in, or link to another profile by using the three dots next to <span class="span_2">Profile</span> field<span class="span_2">. </span></p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Header_Information_..48" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor66"></a>Header Information</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 an in-depth look at client profiles/an in depth look at client_3_615x111.jpg" style="width: 615;height: 111;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>The header conveniently displays pertinent information including <span class="span_2">the current mailing address, communication entries captured for this profile, Email, Number of Marketing Codes, Primary Traveler, Groups, Primary Agent, Date Created, Salutation, Interface ID and program generated Profile No.</span> By confirming the accuracy of this information and adding any new details each time a customer calls, the user ensures that the client data (and agency marketing data) is always up-to-date. </p>
            <p>The Communication entries displayed in the header are first, the Profile's Primary entries; and if space permits, the Primary Traveler's Primary communications follow. If there's still space left, the primary communication entries of the next traveler are shown. </p>
            <p>All of the field labels in the header are clickable and will take the user to that section of the profile. For example, if Marketing Codes is clicked, the Marketing tab opens. </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Profile_Indicators_..49" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor67"></a>Profile Indicators</h3>

            </p>
            <p>Profile indicator icons to the right of the arrows appear if the customer has an active Res Card indicating travel arrangements are in the works (that’s the top, suitcase icon). The middle icon alerts you that this client has previously purchased travel. The third icon (the calendar) alerts you if there are any open reminders for this client. None of the above icons appear in the profile if the client has no active Res Card, open reminder or past travel history with your agency. Click on any of these icons to immediately move into that profile area, i.e. by clicking on the Res Card icon, you’ll get into the Res Card link.</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Date_Fields_..50" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor68"></a>Date Fields</h3>

            <p>This area has the following fields and can be edited: <span class="span_2">Profile Type</span>, selected from drop-down; <span class="span_2">Profile Name; Name</span>; <span class="span_2">Additional Name, </span>which prints on label or invoice. </p>
            <p class="p_4">ADDRESS</p>
            <p>A client profile can include unlimited addresses which may be designated as: <span class="span_2">Primary, Bill To</span>, <span class="span_2">Ship To, Secondary Address and Alternate Address</span>. Only one address though may be designated as Primary, one as Bill To, and one as Ship To. When creating a new address, click <span class="span_2">Add Address</span>, fill in correct address details and choose the address type(s)<span class="span_2">. (</span>Each traveler has the option of having their own address in their traveler record. Remember a traveler record now can be linked to multiple profiles.)</p>
            <p>This area contains the following fields:</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Address Line 1:</span> Enter first line of address.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Address Line 2:</span> Enter second line of address.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Apt/Suite:</span> Enter apartment or suite number.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Zip/City/State/Country: </span>Enter the zip code, city, state, and country of the address. (If the Database Administrator has set up the Zip Code field in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, when you enter a Zip Code, the default City, State and Country populates automatically. On the Edit screen of an address record, the Zip Code field is now positioned in front of the City and State to facilitate this feature.)</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Description:</span> Enter description if desired.</p>
            <p class="p_4">ADDRESS TYPE</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Primary/Bill To/Ship To/Alternate:</span> One address record can represent multiple <span class="span_2">Address Types</span>. Click to select.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Secondary: </span>The <span class="span_2">Secondary Address</span> choice also offers a date option. This is particularly useful because it allows entry of a specific time frame your client may be residing at the Secondary Address. After clicking <span class="span_2">Secondary Address, </span>select the <span class="span_2">From </span>and <span class="span_2">Through</span> months from the drop-down menu. </p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Save/Cancel</span><span class="span_2">:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Save</span> to accept new information or <span class="span_2">Cancel</span>. </p>
            <p>To modify an entry, click <span class="span_2">Edit</span> next to the address you wish to alter, make changes, and click <span class="span_2">Save. </span>To remove an entry, click <span class="span_2">Edit </span>next to the address you wish to remove, and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>. </p>
            <p class="p_4">ADDITIONAL INFO</p>
            <p>These fields provide general information about the profile. To edit fields in this area, click <span class="span_2">Edit</span>, make changes, and click <span class="span_2">Save</span>. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Interface ID:</span> Important! This field allows the interfacing of records generated from the GDS (Front Office) to the agency accounting system (Back Office). If your agency's system requires that this field exist (for example, <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> does) then create an Interface ID as directed by the agency and complete this box. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Primary Agent:</span> This field defaults to the login agent at the time the profile is created. It can be modified to represent the appropriate agent considered primary to the customer (by clicking on the drop-down menu), or left blank.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Salutation:</span> The name used to greet the customer. For example, if Mr. Henry Wilkenson likes to be called “Hank,” enter <span class="span_2">Hank</span> in this field. If Mrs. Emily Anderson likes to be called “Mrs. Anderson,” enter <span class="span_2">Mrs. Anderson</span> in this field. Or, if you have a couple and want to include both names when addressing letters, enter <span class="span_2">Hank and Emily</span>, or <span class="span_2">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Anderson</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Branch No.:</span> For agencies with multiple branches, select from a drop-down menu the branch where this profile is created, or with which you want the profile associated. Branches are setup by the database administrator in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Referred By:</span> By using the drop-down menu, select how this client was referred to your agency. Statistic reporting can be obtained from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to get a bird’s eye view of how new customers are learning of your agency. This is a useful way to evaluate the effectiveness of your advertising. This field is user-definable by the database administrator in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Web ID/Web Password:</span> If your agency is interested in using your website to collect and update customer information, these fields may become important, as most systems require a Web ID and Password to provide access to this type of customer information. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Membership ID: </span>Used at the profile level to capture any special ID number assigned by the agency to the customer account. This can be set up for use by the database administrator in <span>Tools|Settings.</span></p>
            <p class="p_4">SPECIAL DATES</p>
            <p>These fields are particularly useful to record unique dates for each specific customer. Imagine the marketing possibilities, when several months before an anniversary or vacation time, your agency suggests as a gift, a trip reflecting the client’s preferences. (Birthdays do not go in this area, but in the Traveler record!) To add unlimited special dates click on <span class="span_2">Add</span> <span class="span_2">Special Date</span>, fill in special date details, and click <span class="span_2">Save</span>. </p>

            </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Date:</span> Select month from drop-down menu, type day and year. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Comment: </span>Type a comment if desired.</p>

            <p>You have the ability to maintain an unlimited number of Special Dates. To modify an entry, click <span class="span_2">Edit</span> next to the special date you wish to alter, make changes, and click <span class="span_2">Save.</span> To remove an entry, click <span class="span_2">Edit </span>next to the special date you wish to remove, and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>. </p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>A change was made within the internal workings of the program in a previous version that removed the Special Date Type "Birthday" from Special Dates under the hood and moved it into a dedicated field. This change was to keep birthdates at the traveler level where they needed to be and not at a profile level. Although you will not see any visual changes from this, certain birthday queries may take extra time to process. This could happen in instances where the dates searched for in the query cross months or years. Example, if the query is to find all birthdays between December 27, 2011 and January 3, 2012, this query could run slower than it did in previous versions.</p>
            <p>Any reports written that use <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> data (Crystal Reports for example) that involve birthdates will need adjustments, as the internal change made will affect your reports. A new traveler table was created. Birthdate was then removed from the special date table and moved into the new traveler table. The traveler table contains three BIRTHDATE integer fields. All existing records were migrated to these fields.</p>
            <p>o BIRTHMDYMONTH </p>
            <p>o BIRTHMDYDAY </p>
            <p>o BIRTHMDYYEAR </p>
            <p>Here are some example SQL statements that show how special dates were queried in previous versions as compared to version 3.7.</p>
            <p>SAMPLE 1: TRAVELER Birthdays in the month of June</p>

            <p><span class="span_2">Create User/Create Date:</span> These fields default to the system date and the user logged in at the time the profile is created. Both of these fields can be modified. Agencies use the <span class="span_2">Create Date</span> field to query for new customers so that “Welcome to the Agency Letters” and travel surveys can be mailed. These fields are also used to query for management reports reflecting user productivity in creating new client profiles. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Profile Status:</span> Indicate whether a customer profile is <span class="span_2">Inactive</span> from the drop-down menu. By default all profiles start with an <span class="span_2">Active</span> status. An <span class="span_2">Inactive </span>status is included so that you can flag a customer as inactive without having to delete the profile. When querying the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database, only profiles marked as <span class="span_2">Active</span> are included in the search. Locate <span class="span_2">Inactive Profiles</span> by using Level 2 Query.</p>

            <p>If no name is displayed, it is a profile-level communication entry. Communications are now sorted thus - Profile communications are listed first, then the Primary Traveler's communications, then the remaining Traveler communications, in the order that the Travelers are listed in the Travelers section. Within each of those divisions, Primary Communication entries are listed first, then non-primary entries. </p>

            <p>This area contains the following fields:</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Traveler:</span> From the drop-down menu choose what traveler this communication entry is connected with (if applicable). <br />You have the ability to assign a Profile level communication entry to a Traveler, and to assign a Traveler level communication to a different Traveler. This ability is disabled if the communication entry is primary.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Type:</span> Options include <span class="span_2">Email, Fax, Phone, Web, Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, Google Plus</span>. Communication Type options include Social Media. This begins the first phase of social media integration. Fields are now available to begin capturing social media information in order to connect to social media profiles/page(s) in a future release.)</p>

                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 an in-depth look at client profiles/an in depth look at client_7.jpg" style="height: 149px;width: 123px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Begin capturing information by clicking Additional Communications and click Add. Select a traveler and click the drop down to choose a Type from the list. The new types for social media use are:</p>
            <p>Facebook</p>
            <p>Twitter</p>
            <p>Linked In</p>
            <p>Google Plus</p>
            <p>After choosing the Type, enter the User ID (example: facebook.com/JohnSmith). User ID format will vary depending upon the social media type. Next, select a Description. User defined descriptions can be created for specific use with social media. For example, customer John Smith may have a personal profile in Facebook, along with a business page for his company. A description of "Profile" and another of "Page" could be added to differentiate between whether the User ID entered is for the customer's profile or his business page. </p>
            <p>Example Formats for capturing user's social media information:</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Facebook: </span>For a profile - facebook.com/username (facebook.com/JohnSmith); For a page - facebook.com/page name (facebook.com/SabreTravel)</p>

            <p>(Numerical string in the URL is the Google+ ID)</p>
            <p>Just like all other communication types, social media communication types have a Marketing Permission checkbox. Marketing Permission is unchecked by default.</p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>For emails, a green check appears if the entry has been granted marketing permission.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Profile’s Primary</span><span class="span_2">:</span> Indicate if this is the primary phone number, fax, Email, or Web address, since only one entry per communication type may be designated as Primary.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Entry</span><span class="span_2">:</span> You need only type the 7 digits of the Fax number or Phone number if in your area code, as <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> version adds a default country code and area code to the number when saved. For numbers outside your area code, type in the 10 digit area code and number (no other typing is necessary). For Email and Web entries, type these exactly as you want it to appear.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Description</span><span class="span_2">: </span>Choose a description if desired from drop-down menu. These options were setup by the database administrator in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>

            <p>As alternative methods of communicating with customers continue to expand (e.g. cell phones, beepers, additional Emails, etc.), you may find your phone tables growing increasingly lengthy for customer profiles. You have the ability to maintain an unlimited number of communication entries.</p>
            <p>To modify an entry, click <span class="span_2">Edit</span> next to the communication you wish to alter, make changes, and click <span class="span_2">Save. </span>To remove an entry, click <span class="span_2">Edit </span>next to the communication you wish to remove, and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>. </p>

            <p>The Remarks link provides a full-page view of the unlimited remarks and provides tremendous flexibility for entering comments in each customer profile.

            <p>The Marketing Codes link provides the means of tracking client interests and travel preferences, while arming agents with key information to use during the qualifying process of selling leisure travel. Marketing tables are powerful links to clients with common travel interests when planning a direct mail campaign or planning group travel. Reports showing the travel preferences of your customers are extremely valuable in matching up customers and their interests with travel specials. </p>

            </p>
            <p>To add or modify the client’s marketing preferences, click <span class="span_2">Edit. </span>Check or uncheck any marketing codes, and click <span class="span_2">Save </span>or <span class="span_2">Cancel</span>. These Marketing tables and codes are “global,” meaning the same codes are available for use in every profile for every user. Remember that customer’s needs often change. Removing, or editing marketing information when no longer valid is as important as entering new information.</p>

            <p>Use the green up and down arrows to put travelers in any desired order.&#160; Add a new Traveler by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. When a user adds a new traveler record, the database is first automatically searched for any existing travelers that match. If a match is found, the user can select the existing traveler from the list presented and click <span class="span_2">Link</span> to link the existing traveler. </p>
            <p>Any data that was entered while creating the new Traveler that did not exist in the Traveler record that was selected and linked will be retained. </p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> An agent enters a passport number when entering a new Traveler. The agent clicks OK, and search finds an existing traveler record, but the existing record does not have a passport number. When the agent selects the matching traveler record, and data from the traveler record is populated on the screen, the passport information that was missing is now completed also.</p>
            <p><span>Conversely:</span> If data was entered and the existing Traveler record contains information in that field, the existing Traveler data is retained. Example: Agent enters First Name, Last Name, and a birthdate of July 1, 1960, then clicks OK. The Traveler Search results screen appears, and the agent decides to select one of the existing Traveler records. The existing traveler has a birthdate of April 12, 1965. The existing birthdate is kept, not the one the agent entered. (Users can always go back and edit if the original information was incorrect.)</p>
            <p>Clicking <span class="span_2">Cancel </span>returns user to the new Traveler if a link is not found. When clicking <span class="span_2">OK</span>, the new Traveler is created. </p>
            <p>ClientBase checks that all Required/Optional fields are completed. If they are complete, the traveler record is saved and user is taken back to the Travelers screen. If Required/Optional fields are not completed, the user is prompted as to which fields need to be completed. </p>

            </p>
            <p>The <span class="span_2">Search</span> button in the Travelers screen replaces the old Copy and Paste functions in previous versions. If a user knows that the Traveler they want already exists in another profile in the database, they can click <span class="span_2">Search</span> and bring up a Traveler Search screen with the following fields available: </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 an in-depth look at client profiles/travelers link.jpg" style="height: 191px;width: 446px;" class="img_1" />

            <p>- First Name</p>

            <p>- Last Name</p>
            <p>- E-mail Address</p>
            <p>- Phone</p>
            <p>Users can search by phone or e-mail address alone, or in combination with any of the name fields. If searching by name only, users must enter something in at least two of the three name fields.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Valid Examples:</span> </p>
            <p>**User enters First Name of Ken and an e-mail address of ken@example.com. Ken Able, who has that address, is returned; Ken Jones, who does not have that e-mail address, is not.</p>
            <p>**User knows the last name, but isn't sure exactly how the first name is spelled. He enters First Name A and last name Smith. All Travelers whose first name starts with A (Alice, Anne, Alex) and last name starts with Smith (Smith, Smithers, Smith-Jones) are returned.</p>
            <p>**User knows that Mary Anne Jones has married, but doesn't remember the Traveler's new last name. She enters First Name Mary and Middle Name Anne. All Travelers with that first and middle name are returned.</p>
            <p>**User knows the traveler's phone number and enters (650) 555-1212. All travelers with that phone number are returned. </p>
            <p>Linking from the Search screen results here works the same as the automatic search that runs when adding a new traveler. </p>
            <p>Let’s take a look at how to organize information for each Traveler by going through each field of the Add/Modify screen.</p>

            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>A birthday present icon appears during the traveler's birthday month and disappears once the birthday month has passed. A red exclamation point icon appears if the traveler has an expired passport or credit card. Clicking on the exclamation point icon takes the user to Card record if it's an expired credit card, or to the Advanced Traveler Info tab if it's an expired passport. The icon disappears when the expiration date is updated. The Travelers’ link is designed for entering detailed information on specific individuals who are part of a particular household or business. The link is called Traveler when working with an <span class="span_2">Leisure </span>profile or <span class="span_2">Corporate </span>profile, and Contacts when working within any other profile<span class="span_2">.</span></p>

            <p>Traveler Preferences are captured at the vendor level as well as by Travel Category. In the past when a travel preference was created for a traveler it applied to the travel category, not a vendor. For example, if a traveler had an air preference of business class but liked first class for one of his/her preferred airlines, there wasn't a way to capture both. Now the business class air preference can be captured as the global preference for the travel category as well as capturing first class as the preference for the specific preferred vendor. Even though preferences are now captured at the vendor level, it is not mandatory to select preferred preferences for a vendor. It is also not mandatory to select preferred vendors for a traveler. </p>
            <p>To set up/modify preferences, select a traveler and click <span class="span_2">Edit</span>. Scroll down to the desired Travel Category. Each Travel Category shows a "Preferred" section that lists the vendors, with a "Preference" section underneath it. When a vendor is highlighted, the Preference section will change accordingly, displaying the preferences for that vendor.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 an in-depth look at client profiles/these two icons may appear_1.jpg" style="height: 143px;width: 617px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>A <span class="span_2">General Preference</span> is available to each Travel Category under Preferred. Highlight the General Preference and enter the global preferences for the category in the Preference section below it. When a preferred vendor is later added to a Travel Category, the preference settings from General Preference are defaulted as the preferences for the new vendor. Next, make adjustments to the new vendor's preferences as needed. A field, <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> can be used as a rating for a vendor. For example, United Airlines may be a preferred airline for a corporate account but the contact traveling for the company may <span class="span_2">Dislike</span> that airline. By entering the <span class="span_2">Desirability</span>, if you see that the traveler dislikes United, he/she could be booked on another preferred airline the corporate account uses. The <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> field is displayed when adding or viewing a preferred vendor. Desirability options appear as a drop down to select from. Selections are: <span class="span_2">Do Not Use; Dislikes; No Preference; Favorable; or Very Favorable.</span><span>NOTE: </span>For all newly created Travelers the default Traveler Preference is now <span class="span_2">Unknown</span>.</p>
            <p>All Travel Categories now use the user-defined field <span class="span_2">Special Options</span>. Under Air Preferences, Meal Preferences was renamed to Meal Type which links to a Meal Code field that was also added. Air Craft Type was also added as a preference. For Cruise Preferences, Ship Name and Departure Port were added as user defined fields and are displayed as preference options. When using traveler columns for preferences in queries, the default global preferences are displayed in the query.</p>

            <p>This link contains all the Res Cards that were created for this customer. Every time there is a new trip, there is a new res card. A res card allows you to automate your manual reservation data (bookings made outside of your GDS), generate itineraries, tracks reservation totals, invoiced totals and un-invoiced balances.</p>
            <p>To add a new res card, click on the drop-down menu item <span class="span_2">Create Res Card </span>or <span class="span_2">Create Res Card with Live Connect</span>. To modify or enhance a res card click <span class="span_2">View </span>next to the line item. </p>
            <p>Notice the filter buttons located directly above the res card results screen. This allows for quick sorting of the results appearing in this link. By default ALL res cards are displayed, but options for viewing just <span class="span_2">Active, Departed</span>, or <span class="span_2">Canceled</span> Res Cards are available. Also, there is a <span class="span_2">Summary View</span> and <span class="span_2">Detail View </span>of res cards in the listing.</p>

            <p>To enhance the amount and type of information accessible in a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile, a feature is included in all profile types allowing you to point to other files available on your local or network drive. These files are referred to as <span class="span_2">Attachments</span>.</p>
            <p>To access an attachment at the client level, click the <span class="span_2">Attachment </span>link. </p>
            <p>

            <p>To add a new Attachment click <span class="span_2">Add Attachment</span>, and <span class="span_2">Browse for Attachment </span>to identity the File Path of the file. The File Path includes the drive where the file is located, any directories or sub-directories, and the name of the file. Choose to compress the file by clicking in the Compression box. Enter a brief description of the attachment, if desired. Click <span class="span_2">Save</span>.</p>
            <p>To view a saved Attachment, highlight the attachment, and click <span class="span_2">Open </span>next to the attachment. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses Windows Associations to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp, .html, etc.) must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an Attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the Attachment created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
            <p>Since a copy of the file has been stored within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database when it is opened at a workstation, it is loaded temporarily into a temp directory. If any changes are made to the original file or the temporary file, the attachment in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> must be re-directed to the new file, or the old file will still be displayed. This is done by using <span class="span_2">Edit</span> and browsing for the updated file. Once this is done, the copy of the file saved in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database will be updated.</p>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Edit, </span>then <span class="span_2">Delete</span>, next to the attachment to remove it. </p>

            <p><span class="span_2">Display on Screen</span>: When selected, the entry automatically displays on the front screen when Merging to the PNR. If not selected, the entry is displayed on the <span class="span_2">Additional Entries </span>link. Within each PNR Entry or PNR Rule that is set to <span class="span_2">Always Move</span>, an option is included called "Display on Screen". The PNR Selection Screen is the screen that appears when you use the Merge to PNR feature and allows you to select the specific profile data to be included and sent to the current PNR. For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this "Display on Screen" can be set to <span class="span_2">False, </span>so that the Selection Screen is less complicated for the agent to review. Any of these entries that have not been designated to display on the selection screen can be viewed, if desired, by clicking the "Additional Entries Link" in the Merge to PNR feature.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">PNR Entry</span>: Enter the PNR entry the way you would in your reservation system and then <span class="span_2">Save</span>.</p>

            <p>Traveler Preferences are captured at the vendor level as well as by Travel Category. In the past when a travel preference was created for a traveler it applied to the travel category, not a vendor. For example, if a traveler had an air preference of business class but liked first class for one of his/her preferred airlines, there wasn't a way to capture both. Now the business class air preference can be captured as the global preference for the travel category as well as capturing first class as the preference for the specific preferred vendor. Even though preferences are now captured at the vendor level, it is not mandatory to select preferred preferences for a vendor. It is also not mandatory to select preferred vendors for a traveler. </p>
            <p>To set up/modify preferences, select a traveler and click <span class="span_2">Edit</span>. Scroll down to the desired Travel Category. Each Travel Category shows a "Preferred" section that lists the vendors, with a "Preference" section underneath it. When a vendor is highlighted, the Preference section will change accordingly, displaying the preferences for that vendor.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 an in-depth look at client profiles/these two icons may appear_1.jpg" style="height: 143px;width: 617px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>A <span class="span_2">General Preference</span> is available to each Travel Category under Preferred. Highlight the General Preference and enter the global preferences for the category in the Preference section below it. When a preferred vendor is later added to a Travel Category, the preference settings from General Preference are defaulted as the preferences for the new vendor. Next, make adjustments to the new vendor's preferences as needed. A field, <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> can be used as a rating for a vendor. For example, United Airlines may be a preferred airline for a corporate account but the contact traveling for the company may <span class="span_2">Dislike</span> that airline. By entering the <span class="span_2">Desirability</span>, if you see that the traveler dislikes United, he/she could be booked on another preferred airline the corporate account uses. The <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> field is displayed when adding or viewing a preferred vendor. Desirability options appear as a drop down to select from. Selections are: <span class="span_2">Do Not Use; Dislikes; No Preference; Favorable; or Very Favorable.</span><span>NOTE: </span>For all newly created Travelers the default Traveler Preference is now <span class="span_2">Unknown</span>.</p>
            <p>All Travel Categories now use the user-defined field <span class="span_2">Special Options</span>. Under Air Preferences, Meal Preferences was renamed to Meal Type which links to a Meal Code field that was also added. Air Craft Type was also added as a preference. For Cruise Preferences, Ship Name and Departure Port were added as user defined fields and are displayed as preference options.

            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Attachments_Link_..87" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor94"></a>Attachments Link</h3>
            <p>To enhance the amount and type of information accessible in a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile, a feature is included in all profile types allowing you to point to other files available on your local or network drive. These files are referred to as <span class="span_2">Attachments</span>.</p>
            <p>To access an attachment at the client level, click the <span class="span_2">Attachment </span>link. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 an in-depth look at client profiles/these two icons may appear_8_571x230.jpg" style="width: 571;height: 230;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>To add a new Attachment click <span class="span_2">Add Attachment</span>, and <span class="span_2">Browse for Attachment </span>to identity the File Path of the file. The File Path includes the drive where the file is located, any directories or sub-directories, and the name of the file. Choose to compress the file by clicking in the Compression box. Enter a brief description of the attachment, if desired. Click <span class="span_2">Save</span>.</p>
            <p>To view a saved Attachment, highlight the attachment, and click <span class="span_2">Open </span>next to the attachment. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses Windows Associations to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp, .html, etc.) must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an Attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the Attachment created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
            <p>Since a copy of the file has been stored within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database when it is opened at a workstation, it is loaded temporarily into a temp directory. If any changes are made to the original file or the temporary file, the attachment in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> must be re-directed to the new file, or the old file will still be displayed. This is done by using <span class="span_2">Edit</span> and browsing for the updated file. Once this is done, the copy of the file saved in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database will be updated.</p>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Edit, </span>then <span class="span_2">Delete</span>, next to the attachment to remove it. </p>
            <p><span>Note:&#160; </span>Attachments created from a Res Card now appear under that Res Card's attachments link only, not under the related Profile's attachments link.</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="PNR_Entries_Link_..88" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor95"></a>PNR Entries Link</h3>
            <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> PNR entry tables are included at the Branch, Profile, Agent, and Traveler/Contact areas. As a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> user, you may presently create these entries at the profile and agent level only. PNR entries setup at the branch level, as well as any number of PNR Rules (simply a way of designating how certain fields of information captured in a profile should be formatted when sent to a PNR) are setup by the administrator in the Windows version of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
            <p>Store any number of miscellaneous PNR Entries to include when using the Merge to PNR feature for this client. Any PNR entries captured here at the profile level is included regardless of which traveler is travelling. </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">GDS</span>: Choose your GDS system from the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Description of Entry</span>: Enter a free-flow “Description” field.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Always Move</span>: By checking <span class="span_2">Always Move</span>, the entry always moves when you do a merge to GDS. If not selected, moving the entry is optional.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Display on Screen</span>: When selected, the entry automatically displays on the front screen when Merging to the PNR. If not selected, the entry is displayed on the <span class="span_2">Additional Entries </span>link. Within each PNR Entry or PNR Rule that is set to <span class="span_2">Always Move</span>, an option is included called "Display on Screen". The PNR Selection Screen is the screen that appears when you use the Merge to PNR feature and allows you to select the specific profile data to be included and sent to the current PNR. For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this "Display on Screen" can be set to <span class="span_2">False, </span>so that the Selection Screen is less complicated for the agent to review. Any of these entries that have not been designated to display on the selection screen can be viewed, if desired, by clicking the "Additional Entries Link" in the Merge to PNR feature.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">PNR Entry</span>: Enter the PNR entry the way you would in your reservation system and then <span class="span_2">Save</span>.</p>
            <p>For more information on moving data from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to your GDS PNR, please refer to chapter entitled, <span class="span_2">Putting Profiles to Work for you.</span></p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="More_Fields_Link_..89" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor96"></a>More Fields Link</h3>
            <p>If you want to track it, and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> doesn’t ask for it, here is where your database administrator created customized fields of information. Items like Social Security Numbers, client UDID’s and other miscellaneous information that you want to track, can be captured in these fields. </p>
            <p>To tag a profile with a More Field, click <span class="span_2">Edit, </span>and from the drop-down menus next to the More Field Categories, select the More Field item you want to use. Then click <span class="span_2">Save. </span>To untag a More Field Item, simply highlight the item and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span> on the keyboard. </p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>If you enter into the free flow area and there is a partial match within the drop-down choices, if you click the drop-down list, you are taken to that match first. Also, if you make a partial entry into the free flow area and it matches one of the items in the drop-down list, upon tabbing out, the field is completed automatically.</p>
