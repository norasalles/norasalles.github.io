            <p class="p_1">This chapter provides a detailed overview of the Res Card feature in ClientBase.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Introduction_..29" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As your agency implements <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and begins reaping the rewards of improved customer relationships and effective marketing programs, your leisure travel sales should start increasing. To help you better manage this increasing volume of business and track the leads generated by your marketing programs, the <span class="span_2">Res Card</span> has been created. Think of the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card as a home for the many details involved in planning each and every trip for your customers and as a tool that helps you manage the entire trip planning process. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 8 an in-depth look at res cards/an in depth look at res cards.jpg" style="height: 322px;width: 433px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Regardless of the technology agents use or don’t use, regardless of your niche or type of business, regardless of how long agents have been in the business, there are certain fundamental components involved in the <span class="span_2">trip planning process</span>. The <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card has been designed to help agents through each process with the objective of making agents more efficient and effective. In the past, agents may have concentrated more of their attention on just the booking process, but with the advent of airline commission caps, there has been a new emphasis on leisure bookings and a greater need to manage these leisure sales. </p>
            <p>The Res Card feature in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides a perfect tool to integrate all processes in trip planning. By setting up a Res Card, an agent can document the client’s first call by creating a <span class="span_2">Res Card</span> and scheduling a follow-up call (listed on the daily To-Do list) with a <span class="span_2">Reminder. </span>Once the customer is considering the trip, the agent captures details of reservations and prints out trip proposals, itineraries, and invoices while tracking invoiced and uninvoiced balances. By using the Live Connect feature in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, agents have the ability to book reservations via on-line booking engines and then pull all that reservation detail back into the Res Card. Additional notes and reminders can be created to remind an agent of a final payment date or a document confirmation. When the customer returns home, the agent documents his remarks and suggestions. </p>
            <p>Since each Res Card represents one trip, customers are likely to have multiple Res Cards in their profiles at any one time in the <span class="span_2">Res Card </span>profile link. Depending on your agency’s needs, you can enter as much or as little trip information on each Res Card as desired. When talking with your clients and vendors, get in the habit of entering the information directly into the Res Card rather than jotting the notes on paper and then transferring the information into the computer. What a time saver this is, and everyone has access to this information.</p>
            <p>Click the <span class="span_2">Res Card </span>link in the client profile to find a summary of the Res Cards created for this client. Each Res Card represents a different trip for the customer. </p>

So that these types of reservations are not invoiced twice in error (once in GDS, then again in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>), we have added this check box and updated the Res Card balances at the top of a Res Card accordingly. Res Card balances at the top of a Res Card remain the same unless a Reservation exists that has been designated as "Invoiced out of CB".

            <p>Upon entering a Res Card in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, you can create Reminders to help you track the many admnistrative and/or marketing tasks you need to complete for this trip. In the past, you would add a Reminder for each item you wanted to track one at a time. Now, if you have a Batch of Reminders that you would like to use as your default template of Reminders for this trip, you can highlight the Reminder button on the Res Card menu bar and select <span class="span_2">Create Batched Reminders</span> to create multiple Reminders at one time.</p>
            <p><span>Step One:</span> From the Res Card that you would like to create your Reminders, highlight the Reminders button on the Res Card menu bar and select <span class="span_2">Create Batched Reminders</span>. A listing of the Batched Reminders setup under <span>Tools|Settings</span> appear.</p>
            <p><span>Step Two:</span> Select the desired batch you would like the system to default for this Res Card by highlighting and clicking on the desired name.</p>
            <p><span>Step Three:</span> A listing of all of the default Reminders included within the selected batch appears with the <span class="span_2">Date of Reminder</span> defaulting based upon the merge field used. If any of the reminders in the listing do not have a <span class="span_2">Date Completed</span>, then the merge field used was left blank within the current Res Card. In order for these reminders to be created, you must <span class="span_2">Edit</span> the specific reminder within the listing and enter the date by hand.</p>
            <p>From this listing you have the ability to <span class="span_2">Edit, Check and Uncheck, or Add</span> to any of the default reminders. Check each of the reminders within the listing to make sure the defaults are all correct. If you would like to change any of the defaulting reminders, click <span class="span_2">Edit</span> for the desired reminder and update the fields accordingly. Click the box under the column called <span class="span_2">Create</span> to place a check or remove a check next to each specific reminder. Only those reminders containing a check are created. These check defaults are based upon the Always/Optional setting established when the Batch was created under Settings. Click <span class="span_2">Add</span> to add new reminders if you'd like any additional reminders to those the batch defaulted for you. </p>
            <p><span>Step Four:</span> When all of the reminders in the listing meet your needs, click <span class="span_2">Create Reminders</span> and all of the reminders will be created and saved within the <span class="span_2">Activities</span> link of the Res Card. Upon completion, you will land in the Activities link with an updated listing of all activities for this Res Card, including the new reminders just created using your batch.</p>

            <p>To access an attachment at the Res Card level, click the <span class="span_2">Attachment </span>link. To add a new Attachment click <span class="span_2">Add Attachment</span>, and <span class="span_2">Browse for Attachment </span>to identity the File Path of the file. </p>

            </p>
            <p>The File Path includes the drive where the file is located, any directories or sub-directories, and the name of the file. Choose to compress the file by clicking in the Compression box. Enter a brief description of the attachment, if desired. Click <span class="span_2">Save</span>.</p>
            <p>To view a saved Attachment, highlight the attachment, and click <span class="span_2">Open </span>next to the attachment. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses Windows Associations to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp, .html, etc.) must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an Attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the Attachment created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
            <p>Since a copy of the file has been stored within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database when it is opened at a workstation, it is loaded temporarily into a temp directory. If any changes are made to the original file or the temporary file, the attachment in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> must be re-directed to the new file, or the old file will still be displayed. This is done by using <span class="span_2">Edit</span> and browsing for the updated file. Once this is done, the copy of the file saved in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database will be updated.</p>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Edit, </span>then <span class="span_2">Delete</span>, next to the attachment to remove it. </p>

            <p><span class="span_3">IMPORTA</span><span class="span_3">NT:&#160; </span>After saving the reservation, you are taken directly to the Service Provider screen in Edit mode.  Here you can add more info to your reservation. A Service Provider is what the vendor sells (i.e., Princess Cruise Lines may sell the cruise, insurance, a tour, etc.). These all go in one reservation and are added one at time if you want them listed, under the Service Provider Area. Enter the dates of travel, and fill in any other info you want to put on the invoice. Continue adding Service Providers. Click <span class="span_2">Save</span> and <span class="span_2">Close Service Provider. </span></p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>The vendor name will be pre-populated as the Service Provider name if the option <span class="span_2">"Default Service Provider name to Vendor Name"</span> is set by the database administrator. Traveler names will be populated with the reservation travelers.</p>

            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Proceed</span> and <span class="span_2">Close Reservation</span>. If you need to add another reservation for another vendor, follow the instructions above to repeat.</p>
            <p><span>STEP NINE - GENERATE INVOICE:</span> After all reservations have been created, click the <span class="span_2">Generate Invoice</span> icon on menu bar at top of screen. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Select any remarks you want to appear on bottom of invoice by clicking Remarks, enter a Trip Balance Due Date if applicable, choose the Form of Payment and pick cc# from drop-down, and in the <span class="span_2">This Invoice area</span>, put amount of this invoice (for a deposit just pick the first reservation, for final payment each reservation needs to have correct Submit To/Travel Type. If the Submit to is Commission Track, make sure to check off <span class="span_2">Showed as Paid</span>, a little checkbox that appears only with Commission Track Submit To so that totals appear on the invoice. (This may have been preset by database administrator.) </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Preview</span>. - Display a PDF version which shows what the invoice will look like when generated, including remarks and order of reservations.&#160; For best results, use Adobe Reader version 9 or higher with Internet Explorer, and enable the Adobe PDF plug-in.

            <p>The Tax and Commission Default settings found under <span>Tools|Settings|</span><span>Global Defaults|</span><span>Res Card Tax and Commission Defaults </span>provides an area in the General Tab to put all tax rates including GST/HST if not already setup in TBO.

                <br />
            </p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>There is a setting in the General Tab, <span class="span_2">Include </span><span class="span_2">GST/HST </span>Rate for agencies in areas that use GST/HST but are not required to calculate taxes based on Province (the Caribbean), using this setting ignores the rates set up by Province under the Region Tax tab, but will instead use the Global rate entered as the default. Upon checking this box a GST/HST Rate field is displayed. Enter the Global rate to be used in calculating the taxes.</p>
            <p>The Regional Taxes button is designed to capture default tax rates by Province. All 14 Canadian Provinces are included within this table along with a default tax rate. These Provinces and Tax rate defaults can be updated using the <span class="span_2">Add</span><span class="span_2">, </span><span class="span_2">Modify</span> and <span class="span_2">Delete</span>.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 8 an in-depth look at res cards/itinerary report link_9.png" />
            </p>
            <p><span>2) </span>Upon entering new Reservations in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card the default GST/HST rate used for both Client GST/HST and Commission GST HST is now determined by the Travel Category and the new Province table located in Step 1 above under <span>Tools|Settings|</span><span>Global Defaults|Res Card Tax and Commission Defaults</span><span>.</span></p>
            <p>a) For Air, Hotel, Cruise, Tour, Rail and Transportation reservations, make sure in each of the Vendor Profiles used for these types of reservations have a <span class="span_6">Province </span><span class="span_6">filled in</span>, and in the <span class="span_6">Country </span><span class="span_6">field</span>, either leave blank, type Canada or CA.</p>
            <p>b) Car reservations look at the <span class="span_2">Pick Up City Province</span> field in the Service Provider area to determine the default GST/HST rate to apply. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 8 an in-depth look at res cards/itinerary report link_10.png" />
            </p>
            <p>(<span>Note:</span> If the GST/HST amounts have already been entered and the Pick Up City Province rate is different, the user gets prompted with the option to override the current amounts.)</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 8 an in-depth look at res cards/note if the gst hst amounts.png" style="height: 99px;width: 428px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>c) Service Fees look to the <span class="span_6">client profile’s </span><span class="span_6">Province</span><span class="span_6"> field</span> to determine the default GST/HST rate to apply.</p>
            <p>d) Insurance and International defaults as <span class="span_6">zero rated</span>.</p>
            <p>e) Transborder Reservations <span class="span_6">default to 5% for all Travel Categories</span>.</p>
            <p>Please note that these default rates are simply defaults and can be updated on a reservation-by reservation basis. If the user overrides a reservation percentage in either the client GST/HST field or the Commission GST/HST field, <span class="span_6">the other field will be updated to reflect the same percentage</span>.</p>
            <p>For example, if client GST/HST is defaulted to 5% and user changes it to 13%, then the Commission HST changes to 13% also, and vice versa. If the user wants to override one percentage, but not the other, then a dollar amount must be entered in place of a percentage.</p>
            <p>Since a large portion of the Commission GST/HST calculations is based on the profile Province where the client or vendor resides, <span>it is important to ensure your client and vendor profiles contain a Province and non</span><span class="span_7">-</span><span>Canadian profiles contain a Country code. </span>The province should use 2 letter codes as follows: BC, AB, etc.</p>
            <p><span>3) </span>The look-up logic on the profile will first look for Canadian profiles by checking the country field. If the <span>Country</span> field contains <span class="span_2">CANADA, CA or is blank</span>, it will look in the <span>Province</span> field to determine if there’s a match to one of the Provinces in the rate table and if so, use the applicable rate to calculate the default GST/HST for the Reservation.</p>
            <p><span>4) </span>Querying profiles and sorting by Country and Province will help you quickly locate profiles with empty fields and the Global Modify feature (used with caution) can help to easily populate those fields. </p>
            <p>Be sure to backup your database before using the Global Modify feature. </p>
            <p><span>5) </span>For cars, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses the <span class="span_6">Pickup City in the Service Provider</span> record and then uses the city code table to locate the province and lookup the province rate. </p>
            <p>Therefore, <span>it is also important that your city code table </span>(Tools|Settings|User Defined Fields|City Codes)<span> has province codes for each applicable city and they match the province codes included in the Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Tax and Commission Defaults.</span></p>
            <p><span>6) </span>Both Client GST/HST and Commission GST/HST amounts can be viewed in the reservation at the same time.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 8 an in-depth look at res cards/note if the gst hst amounts_1_720x118.png" style="width: 720;height: 118;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>That means agents do not need to click on the More Taxes tab to view the effects on the Commission GST/HST when making changes to the Client GST/HST or vice versa.</p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> If using Live Connect and PNR Import features so that if GST/HST applies, and no Commission GST/HST is included in the file, the same logic described above is used to default the Commission GST/HST rate.</p>

            <p>From this area you can customize the following settings for just the current invoice being generated:</p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Default Invoice Format:</span> Set the Res Card invoice default as Invoice Only which is a shorter invoice format that does not included all itinerary level information; or Itin/Invoice which is a longer invoice format that does include all the itinerary level information. </p>
            <p><span>Language: </span>From the drop-down, select the language used for invoice.</p>
            <p><span>Include Summary of All Reservations:</span> Set the Res Card invoice default by checking if you want reservation details including balance due date to appear on the invoice. </p>
            <p><span>Preview Invoice Before Printing:</span> Set the Res Card invoice default by checking if you always want a preview invoice (highly recommended) to be printed before actually generating the invoice. </p>
            <p><span>Include Service Provider Graphics:</span> Set the Res Card invoice defaults by checking here if you want service provider graphics included when an invoice is printed. </p>
            <p><span>Hide Reservation Vendor Name: </span>Gives you greater flexibility in customizing the print out of an invoice. If this setting is checked, then the Vendor Name for each individual reservation within the Res Card being invoice will not be printed, only the Service Provider Names. </p>
            <p><span>Hide Reservation Totals (Include Only Invoice Totals):</span> Gives you greater flexibility in customizing the print out of an invoice. If this setting is checked, then each individual reservation amount will not be printed, only the sum of all reservations being invoiced. </p>
            <p><span>Print Service Fee as Invoice Total Line Item:</span> Gives you greater flexibility in customizing the print out Service Fees on an invoice. If checked, this setting adds any reservations with a Travel Category of Service Fee and prints them as a single total amount listed within the Invoice Totals just underneath Reservation Totals, rather than listing as a separate reservation within the body of the invoice.</p>
            <p><span>Service Fee Label:</span> This is a free-flow field that allows for up to 25 characters and provides you with the ability to customize how agency service fees are labeled on the invoice. </p>
            <p><span>Print Reservation in Condensed Format:</span> The following Print Reservation in Condensed Format are broken down by Travel Category:</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Print Air Reservation in Condensed Format, Print Hotel Reservation in Condensed Format, Print Car Reservation in Condensed Format, Print Cruise Reservation in Condensed Format, Print Insurance Reservation in Condensed Format, Print Miscellaneous Reservation in Condensed Format, Print Rail Reservation in Condensed Format, Print Tour Reservation in Condensed Format, and Print Transportation Reservation in Condensed Format</span>.</p>
            <p>If checked, upon invoicing a reservation for that Travel Category, a summary of basic Reservation information is included, rather than a detailed listing of all Reservation and Service Provider level information. This setting may be desired for reservations that you would like to place less emphasis on when printing invoices for your client. For example, if you are invoicing a cruise vacation, you may choose to place a greater emphasis on the cruise reservation and less emphasis on the Insurance, Airport, Hotel, etc. </p>
            <p>Here is a listing of the reservation details included if Print Reservation in Condensed Format is checked. All other Reservation and Service Provider level data is omitted from the printed version of the invoice. </p>
            <p>- Vendor Name, Traveler Name/s, Start Date, End Date </p>
            <p>If Supplier, ARC or Comm Track Show as Paid: Res Amount, This Invoice, Prior Invoice and Balance </p>
            <p>If Comm Track Not Show as Paid: Amount Details </p>

            <p>This feature allows you to include both sales and refunds on one invoice. Therefore, you can refund a cancelled reservation and invoice a service fee all at the same time on the same invoice. You can also refund one reservation and invoice another that has been booked in its place. If there are more refunds than sales, a Refund Invoice is generated. If there are more sales than refunds, a Sales Invoice is generated.</p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="Setting_Up_to_Refund_Invoices" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Setting Up to Refund Invoices</h4>
            <p>Before generating any refund invoices you must first setup your Refund Invoice Number series. Select <span>Tools|Settings|Branch Settings</span> and double-click the branch record you want to generate refunds in. In the <span class="span_2">Next Refund Invoice field</span>, enter your starting number in the refund invoice number series. Make sure the number series you select is not already being used in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>, or does not conflict with a refund number series used by any other invoicing tool such as your GDS. Repeat these steps for each branch for which refund invoices are generated.</p>
            <p>All users will have the ability to generate refund invoices by default. To disable this feature for a user you need to update their User Login. To do this the System Administrator must log into the database as SYSDBA. From <span>Tools|Settings|User Logins,</span> select the user you would like to disable the refund invoice setting for and click the Advanced button and then Other Restrictions. Check the box next to the setting <span class="span_2">Disable Refunding an Invoice from Res Card</span> and save.</p>
