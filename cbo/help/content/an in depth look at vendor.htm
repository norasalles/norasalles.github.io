            <p class="p_1">This chapter familiarizes you with how to setup, maintain and use Vendor and Service Provider Profiles.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Introduction_..13" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Vendor profiles provide an easily accessible source for an agency to store pertinent information about its travel suppliers. Tour operators, cruise lines, hotels and car rental companies are examples of vendor profiles that an agency uses. All the important details about this vendor are stored in one convenient place that each user has access to. Key information such as phone numbers, rep contacts, supplier addresses, commission information, specials, preferred vendor status, cancellation policies, and more may be included in the profile.</p>
            <p>Service Provider profiles represent the various components of a trip booked through a vendor. For example, the service provider for a Carnival Cruise booking would be the Carnival Destiny. Pertinent details about the Destiny are stored in this type of profile and therefore accessible to users. Feedback from other contacts can be added in and accessed by all agents to better serve future clients. </p>
            <p>Why do we go to such lengths to differentiate between the two? It is so that client comments and feedback can be attached to specific service provider profiles and for invoicing purposes. </p>
            <p>In the past, agencies kept track of this vendor and service provider information in a variety of ways. Some agents use rolodexes with vendor and service provider special contact names and lists of phone numbers for each department. Other agents have links which included brochures, specials, as well as any communication information they were able to obtain for each of the vendors and service providers. Still other agents memorize vital vendor and service provider information.</p>
            <p>When a customer travels with a particular service provider and supplies your agency with feedback information on its services, how is this information distributed to agents? Is there one place an agent can go that summarizes what customers felt about a particular trip or service? Or one place that the agent can look for promotions that are current, or if the vendor is still preferred? With <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, all vendor and service provider information is in one place. By creating rich, information-filled profiles for the vendors and service providers you sell, each agent has quick access to this vital information. </p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Create_a_New_Vendor_Service_Provider_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Create a New Vendor/Service Provider Profile</h2>
            <p>New vendor or service provider profiles can be created by clicking on the profile icon on the tool bar and selecting <span class="span_2">Service Provider</span> or <span class="span_2">Vendor. </span></p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 12 an in-depth look at vendor and service provider profiles.doc/an in depth look at vendor_624x166.png" style="width: 624;height: 166;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Want a quick way to create a profile? Use the following <span class="span_2">hot keys:</span></p>
            <p>Alt shift S = New Service Provider or Alt shift V = New Vendor.</p>
            <p>After clicking <span class="span_2">Create Profile</span>, you can enter information on a new vendor on the <span class="span_2">Quick Entry</span> form. The Quick Entry form consists of two screens, one for the Profile and one for the <span class="span_2">Primary Contact</span>. All Required and Optional fields are displayed, along with the basics: <span class="span_2">Profile Type, Profile Name, Last Name/First Name/Middle Name/Courtesy Title of </span><span class="span_2">Vendor Contact, Address, Primary Phone, Interface ID, and Branch</span>. Required and optional fields are indicated with peach and green shading, respectively.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>When you click on <span class="span_2">Next, </span>you land on the Primary Contact screen, and after a user fills in the fields and clicks <span class="span_2">Save</span>, a search is performed behind the scenes based on the name fields and the phone and email fields. If a match is found, the user is prompted with a list of the matching Traveler/Contacts and is given the opportunity to either link the existing Traveler/Contact to the new Profile, or to cancel out and create a new Contact. </p>
            <p>If a user does not have permission to access a certain profile type, they will be unable to create profiles of that type. If a user has no permission to view a profile tab which has required fields for a certain profile type, the user will not be able to create a profile of that type. </p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Anatomy_of_a_Vendor|Service_Provider_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Anatomy of a Vendor|Service Provider Profile</h2>
            <p>A Vendor Profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> stores an unlimited amount of information about your vendors and service providers. To organize all this information and make it easily accessible to all users, each vendor profile is made up of these key areas: <span class="span_2">Menu Bar, Header Info, Indicator Icons, and Information Links:</span></p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 12 an in-depth look at vendor and service provider profiles.doc/an in depth look at vendor_1_607x417.png" style="width: 607;height: 417;" />
            </p>
            <p>Let’s explore each of these key areas:</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Menu_Bar_..14" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Menu Bar</h3>
            <p>The menu bar contains links to features - <span class="span_2">Merge Options, Note, Mailer and Reminder.</span> </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 12 an in-depth look at vendor and service provider profiles.doc/an in depth look at vendor_2_624x69.png" style="width: 624;height: 69;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Merge To Document </span>enables you to launch a Document Template from the results of a query into Wordpad, MS Word, Open Office, etc. to view, edit and print the document with all fields merged. <span class="span_2">Merge To Email </span>launches an email message for the profile you are in. <span class="span_2">Merge To Label</span> enables you to create a label for this profile. </p>
            <p>You can also create a <span class="span_2">Note, Mailer, or Reminder </span>from the menu bar for the profile you are in, or link to another profile by using the three dots next to <span class="span_2">Profile</span> field<span class="span_2">. </span></p>
            <p>For complete instructions on <span class="span_2">Merge To Document, Merge to Email, </span>or <span class="span_2">Merge to Label, </span>see chapter, <span class="span_2">Putting Profiles to Work for You.</span> </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Header_Information_..15" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Header Information</h3>
            <p>The Header conveniently displays pertinent information including the current mailing address, number of Marketing Codes, Primary Contact, Groups, Primary Agent, Create Dates, Salutation, Interface ID, and Profile Number. By confirming the accuracy of this information and adding any new details, the user ensures that vendor data is always up-to-date. </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Profile_Indicators_..16" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Profile Indicators</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 12 an in-depth look at vendor and service provider profiles.doc/an in depth look at vendor_2.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>A Trams profile indicator icon to the right of the arrows appear if the agency has previously booked travel with this Vendor. The other icon (a finger with a red string) alerts you if there are any open reminders for this vendor. These icons do not appear in the profile if the agent has no open reminder or past travel history with your agency. Click on one of these icons to immediately move into that profile area, i.e. by clicking on the Travel History icon, you’ll get into the Travel History link.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Detailed_Review_of_Links_..17" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor138"></a>Detailed Review of Links</h2>
            <p>Each profile contains the following information links: <span>General Info,</span> <span>Communications, Remarks, Agency Remarks, Marketing Codes, Contacts, Activities, Travel History, Groups, and Attachments.</span> </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="General_Info_Link_..18" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>General Info Link</h3>

            <p>The Remarks link provides a full-page view of the unlimited remarks and provides tremendous flexibility for entering comments in each vendor/service provider profile. To add or edit a remark, click <span class="span_2">Edit Text</span>, and click <span class="span_2">Save</span> or <span class="span_2">Cancel. </span>The great thing about remarks is that the first few lines can be viewed from anywhere in the profile. </p>

            <p>Here is another area where unlimited, free-flowing Agency remarks can be entered about this Vendor/Service Provider. Whenever agents are in this profile, they can access what other agents have written about this Vendor or Service Provider. Such information is valuable so that each agent in your office can benefit from the collective experience gained by all customers and agents.</p>
            <p>To add or edit a remark, click <span class="span_2">Edit Text</span> and click <span class="span_2">Save</span> or <span class="span_2">Cancel. </span></p>

            </p>
            <p>The Marketing link provides a way to track vendors/service providers by adding data about the supplier in a manner that an agency can query. For example, in a vendor profile, check off destinations that can be booked, or a budget, or the type of travel. Then when searching for a vendor/service provider that meets the client's requirements, the agent can query on the specific Marketing Codes. To add or modify a vendor/service provider marketing code, click <span class="span_2">Edit. </span>Check or uncheck any marketing codes, and click <span class="span_2">Save </span>or <span class="span_2">Cancel</span>. </p>
            <p>These Marketing Tables and codes are “global,” meaning the same codes are available for use in every profile for every user. Remember that vendor qualifications often change. Removing marketing information when no longer valid is as important as entering new information.</p>

            <p>The <span class="span_2">Contact </span>link is designed for detailed information on specific individuals who are key contacts with a Vendor/Service Provider.<img src="resources/images/chapter 12 an in-depth look at vendor and service provider profiles.doc/an in depth look at vendor_9.jpg" style="height: 302px;width: 702px;" class="img_1" /></p>
            <p>These two icons may appear in the Contact header and are visual alerts of important dates:</p>

            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>A birthday present icon appears during the contact's birthday month and disappears once the birthday month has passed. A red exclamation point icon appears if the contact has an expired passport or credit card. Clicking on the exclamation point icon takes the user to Card record if it's an expired credit card, or to the Advanced Contact Info tab if it's an expired passport. The icon disappears when the expiration date is updated.The Contacts’ link is designed for entering detailed information on specific individuals who are part of a particular profile. The link is called Traveler when working with an <span class="span_2">Leisure </span>profile, and Contacts when working within any other profile<span class="span_2">.</span></p>
            <p>Add a new contact by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. To modify or enhance an contact, click <span class="span_2">View </span>in front of the contact name, and then <span class="span_2">Edit.</span> Click <span class="span_2">Edit</span>, then <span class="span_2">Delete</span> to remove a contact. </p>

            <p>The <span class="span_2">Search</span> button in the Contacts screen replaces the old Copy and Paste functions in previous versions. If a user knows that the contact they want already exists in another profile in the database, they can click <span class="span_2">Search</span> and bring up a Contact Search screen with the following fields available: </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 12 an in-depth look at vendor and service provider profiles.doc/an in depth look at vendor_12.jpg" style="height: 191px;width: 446px;" class="img_1" />

            <p class="p_6">- Phone</p>
            <p>Users can search by phone or e-mail address alone, or in combination with any of the name fields. If searching by name only, users must enter something in at least two of the three name fields.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Valid Examples:</span> </p>
            <p>**User enters First Name of Ken and an e-mail address of ken@example.com. Ken Able, who has that address, is returned; Ken Jones, who does not have that e-mail address, is not.</p>
            <p>**User knows the last name, but isn't sure exactly how the first name is spelled. He enters First Name A and last name Smith. All contacts whose first name starts with A (Alice, Anne, Alex) and last name starts with Smith (Smith, Smithers, Smith-Jones) are returned.</p>
            <p>**User knows that Mary Anne Jones has married, but doesn't remember the contact's new last name. She enters First Name Mary and Middle Name Anne. All contacts with that first and middle name are returned.</p>
            <p>**User knows the contact's phone number and enters (650) 555-1212. All contacts with that phone number are returned. </p>
            <p>Linking from the Search screen results here works the same as the automatic search that runs when adding a new contact. </p>
            <p>Let’s take a look at how to organize information for each contact by going through each field of the Add/Modify screen.</p>

For subsequent Travelers and Contacts added, the box is unchecked by default. If a user checks the box when adding a new Traveler or Contact, designating them as Primary, then the box will automatically be unchecked for the original Primary. There can be only one Primary Traveler/Contact per profile. </p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Last Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the legal last name of contact. </p>
            <p><span class="span_3">First Name</span><span>:</span> Enter the first name of the contact in this field. This provides you with the correct information for booking purposes. </p>

            <p><span class="span_3">Courtesy Title</span><span>:</span> Mr., Mrs., Mr. &amp; Mrs., Ms., Dr. are all examples of courtesy titles. The drop-down menu allows you to select from a customized list. This courtesy title can printed on mail labels and letters.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Contact Travel Preferences are captured at the vendor level as well as by Travel Category. In the past when a travel preference was created for a contact it applied to the travel category, not a vendor. For example, if a contact had an air preference of business class but liked first class for one of his/her preferred airlines, there wasn't a way to capture both. Now the business class air preference can be captured as the global preference for the travel category as well as capturing first class as the preference for the specific preferred vendor. Even though preferences are now captured at the vendor level, it is not mandatory to select preferred preferences for a vendor. It is also not mandatory to select preferred vendors for a contact. </p>
            <p>To set up/modify preferences, on the Contact screen, select a contact and click Edit. Scroll down to the desired Travel Category. Each Travel Category shows a "Preferred" section that lists the vendors, with a "Preference" section underneath it. When a vendor is highlighted, the Preference section will change accordingly, displaying the preferences for that vendor.</p>
            <p>A <span class="span_2">General Preference</span> is available to each Travel Category under Preferred. Highlight the General Preference and enter the global preferences for the category in the Preference section below it. When a preferred vendor is later added to a Travel Category, the preference settings from General Preference are defaulted as the preferences for the new vendor. Next, make adjustments to the new vendor's preferences as needed. A field, <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> can be used as a rating for a vendor. For example, United Airlines may be a preferred airline for a corporate account but the contact traveling for the company may <span class="span_2">Dislike</span> that airline. By entering the <span class="span_2">Desirability</span>, if you see that the contact dislikes United, he/she could be booked on another preferred airline the corporate account uses. The <span class="span_2">Desirability</span> field is displayed when adding or viewing a preferred vendor. Desirability options appear as a drop down to select from. Selections are: <span class="span_2">Do Not Use; Dislikes; No Preference; Favorable; or Very Favorable.</span></p>
            <p>All Travel Categories use the user-defined field <span class="span_2">Special Options</span>. Under Air Preferences, Meal Preferences was renamed to Meal Type which links to a Meal Code field that was also added. Air Craft Type was also added as a preference. For Cruise Preferences, Ship Name and Departure Port were added as user defined fields and are displayed as preference options. When using contact columns for preferences in queries, the default global preferences are displayed in the query.</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Save/Cancel</span><span>:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Save</span> to accept new information, or <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> to leave area without saving changes. </p>

            <p>Any agent can see the history of contacts made with a specific Vendor/Service Provider by clicking on the Activities link, as long as they have been granted permission. This link displays a complete history of all contacts associated with this specific vendor. Included are Notes (record of interaction with vendor), Reminders (record of scheduled past and future activities) and Mailers (record detailing mailings sent to this vendor). To add a new Note, Reminder or Mailer, click on the drop-down menu <span class="span_2">Create Activity</span>. To modify or enhance a Note, Reminder or Mailer click <span class="span_2">Edit </span>next to the item. Click <span>Edit|Delete</span> to remove any item. </p>
            <p>Notice the filter buttons located directly above the Activities results screen. This allows for quick sorting of the results appearing in this link. By default ALL Activities are displayed, but options for viewing just Mailers, Notes, Reminders, or Open Reminders are available. Also, there is a <span class="span_2">Summary View</span> and <span class="span_2">Detail View </span>of activities in the listing.</p>

            <p>To view a saved attachment, highlight the attachment, and click <span class="span_2">Open </span>next to the attachment. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses Windows associations to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp, .html, etc.) that must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the attachment created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
            <p>Since a copy of the file has been stored within the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database when it is opened at a workstation, it is loaded temporarily into a temp directory. If any changes are made to the original file or the temporary file, the attachment in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> must be re-directed to the new file, or the old file will still be displayed. This is done by using <span class="span_2">Edit</span> and browsing for the updated file. Once this is done, the copy of the file saved in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database is updated.</p>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Edit, </span>then <span class="span_2">Delete</span>, next to the attachment to remove it.</p>
