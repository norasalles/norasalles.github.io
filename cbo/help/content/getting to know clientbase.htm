            <p>The File Managers consists of&#160;Dashboard, Profiles,&#160;Activities,&#160;and&#160;Res Cards.&#160;</p>
            <p>The Profiles&#160;Manager provides quick access to vital information about your Leisure or Corporate clients, Service Provider, Vendor, Agent and Other profiles (non-travel related entities, such as the electric company or landlord). From this area&#160;search, add,&#160;or&#160;modify&#160;profile records.</p>
            <p>The Activities&#160;Manager allows you to easily manage activity data (Notes, Reminders and Mailers) and provides search filters and results listed by Activity.&#160;</p>
            <p>The Res Cards Manager&#160;allows you to easily manage Res Card data and provides search filters and results listed by Res Cards.</p>

            <p>When selecting the Profile Manager, search (or query) filters appear or select a stored set of query filters (Global&#160;or&#160;Personal Saved Searches) from the drop-down menus. You can also use a simple or advanced search to enter a custom search. (To view all profiles, click&#160;Find.)</p>
            <p>The&#160;Global Saved Searches&#160;represent a set of search filters and column arrangements that have been saved and named. With a single click of the mouse from these drop-down menus, these links automatically complete search filters and display results after clicking&#160;Find.

            </p>
            <p>When querying a profile, enter the first few letters and the system automatically displays all names that are possible matches. For example, if you are searching for the client, Ken Able, type Able in the Profile Name/Company field and the system automatically displays any profile with the last name of Able. If you type Able/K,&#160;ClientBase&#160;further filters the names showing only those with Able as the last name and the first names that start with an "A". This works for all Profile Types and all Profile name fields.</p>

            <p>Res Cards&#160;replace the paper index Res Card and file folders that have for years cluttered agencies. In the past, agents entered details of many leisure type reservations (client information, confirmation numbers, itineraries, vendor information, remarks, etc.) on cards or yellow paper pads. Agents kept these cards somewhere on their desk or somewhere in the file. That “somewhere” translated into precious time spent searching for Res Cards, especially when the booking agent was not available, and another agent had to locate the card.</p>
            <p>With&#160;Res Cards, you now have a tool to organize and maintain reservation information in a central database. If agents get in the habit when talking with clients or vendor/service providers of entering the details directly into the Res Card rather than jotting the notes on paper when a customer calls, any agent is able to answer questions or update information by accessing the customer’s Res Card. (This data provides valuable reports for management as well.)</p>
            <p>When selecting the Res Cards Manager, search (or query) filters appear or select a stored set of query filters (Global&#160;or&#160;Personal Saved Searches) from the drop-down menus. You can also use a simple or advanced search to enter a custom search. (To view all profiles, click&#160;Find.)</p>

            <p>Automatically Update E-mail Calendar for Uncompleted Reminders:&#160;Enable the ability to update an E-mail calendar with Reminders created in&#160;ClientBase. Select from the drop-down:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Never:&#160;Reminders are never sent to the e-mail calendar.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>All Reminders:&#160;All Open Reminders are sent to the e-mail calendar.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Only Reminders set for a Time: Only Open Reminders with a selected Start Time are sent to the e-mail calendar.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Only Reminders set with an Alarm: Only Open Reminders with the Set Alarm Box checked are sent to the e-mail calendar</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The user's e-mail address is used for sending Reminders to the E-mail Calendar. If the user does not have an e-mail address entered in their User Settings,&#160;Never&#160;is the only setting that can be entered for this field.</p>
            <p>When creating or editing reminders a new checkbox,&#160;Update E-mail Calendar after Saving Changes&#160;was added. When checked, updates are sent to user's e-mail address. This box is checked by default when the setting from User Settings is&#160;All Reminders&#160;or&#160;Only for Reminders when time is set.</p>
            <p>Upon saving the Reminder, an e-mail is sent to the user. If the&#160;Default E-mail Client setting is Outlook/MAPI Client or MAPI Client, the e-mail includes the e-mail appointment setup screen as an attachment. Open the attachment and click&#160;Save and Close&#160;to save the Reminder to the e-mail calendar. If&#160;Default E-mail Client setting is SMTP, the e-mail appears as a meeting request and includes a link to the Activity. Click&#160;Accept&#160;to save the Reminder to the e-mail calendar.</p>
            <p>Saved Search Defaults:&#160;Each file manager (Profile, Activity, and Res Card) comes with a default set of folders, which represent a stored set of search filters. In addition to the default folders, your agency and agents can create their own custom folders. This area of the user login allows you to identify which folder should be opened by default (within each manager) when first signing into&#160;ClientBase. Choose from the drop-down menu the types of transactions you want to see when first entering&#160;ClientBase&#160;with this login.</p>
            <p>Profile Defaults:&#160;Each profile type is made up of several links’ information. Under Profile Defaults, select which link fist appears when viewing each type of profile. For example, you may to see marketing information when you first open a Leisure profile. If so, click the down arrow next to Leisure and select Marketing. You can select any link for any profile type.</p>
            <p>Communication Defaults:&#160;The agency is no longer confined to its four walls. With so many outside agents and employees working from distant locations, customers come with many different area codes and even from different countries. Agent users have the opportunity to save default phone information as part of their log in.&#160;Note:&#160;If this screen is left blank, then information that is listed under Settings (Global Defaults) is used.</p>
            <p>Live Connect:&#160;This set-up setting area is for agencies who want to use Live Connect in the Res Card. Set up for Live Connect agent logins can be done in two ways - globally (if all agents share the same user name, password or account number), or individually. When Live Connect is launched, the system first looks to see if there is login information at the User Login level, and if not, then looks for the login information at the Settings (Global Defaults) level.</p>

            <h2><a name="Meet_the_Search_Filters" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Meet the Search Filters</h2>
            <p>Your database holds a wealth of information on your customers - marketing activities, communication and address information, traveler/contact preferences, and more. This information is of little value unless you can quickly and easily access the data you need. The search (query) feature provides filters to quickly sift through your data to match your required search criteria.</p>
            <p> <img src="resources/images/cbo help files_getting to know (1)/getting to know clientbase_1_28.png" /></p>
            <p>You have the ability to do simple or complex searches based on the selected search filters in the Profile, Activity or Res Card Managers.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3><a name="Simple_Search" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Simple Search</h3>
            <p>Quickly locate a profile or a group of profiles by completing one or two search filters in the simple search area.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/cbo help files_getting to know (1)/getting to know clientbase_1.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>The drop-down field to the left identifies what you want to search by, and the blank field to the right provides an area to type in search data. If you choose to use both fields, then the criteria are strung together with an "and", not an "or", and only those profiles that meet both query fields are displayed as a match.</p>
            <p>When searching for a profile, enter the first few letters and the system automatically displays all names that are possible matches. For example, if you are searching for the client, Jane Smith, type Smith in the Last Name field and the system automatically displays any profile with the last name of Smith. If you type Smith/J,&#160;ClientBase&#160;further filters the names showing only those with Smith as the last name and the first names that start with a "J". This works for all Profile Types and all Profile name fields.</p>
            <p>All leisure clients with the last name starting with "smith" appear in the results area. Select the client name you want and click&#160;Find.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3><a name="Advanced_Search_..91" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Advanced Search</h3>
            <p>Advanced Search provides additional filters that allow you to more narowly define what you are looking for.</p>
            <p> <img src="resources/images/cbo help files_getting to know (1)/getting to know clientbase_1_29.png" /></p>
            <p>Search filters are selected by clicking&#160;Go to Advanced Search, then&#160;Enter Data to Search by,&#160;and completing as many of the search fields as desired in the&#160;General Info, Marketing Codes, Activities, Traveler/Contact, Res Card, More Field&#160;or Travel History links. Each field selected is strung together with an “and” that more narrowly defines the search. For example, you have just received a hot cruise special to Europe and want to get a number of all past and potential cruise clients interested in Europe and living in the 90045 zip code to see if you should do a mailing. Select&#160;Leisure&#160;under&#160;Profile Type;&#160;“90045” in the&#160;Zip Code&#160;field;&#160;“Europe” and "Cruise" under&#160;Marketing&#160;categories and click&#160;OK.&#160;You have selected the filters to search your database for all leisure clients who expressed an interest in cruising and want to go to Europe and live in the 90045 zip code area. When you click&#160;OK,&#160;all clients in the database meeting the search criteria are displayed on the results screen.</p>
