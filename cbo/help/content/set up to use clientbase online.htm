            <p class="p_1">This section provides a general overview of ClientBase Online, how it fits into agency operations, what it is, and what it can do for your agency and front-line agents. It also outline the steps you need to successfully implement your new program.</p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..96" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Look around your desk. What do you see? Pictures of family, a phone, a calendar from one of the cruise lines, facial tissue. But wait! What’s that behind all those Post-it notes? It’s a computer! In most cases, it was put there as a terminal for a Computer Reservation System (CRS), or as it’s called now days, Global Distribution System (GDS). If you are like many agents, you use it to book travel for clients and to find information on airfares, seats, hotel rooms, car rentals, etc. You may even use it to handle e-mail and browse the web, but not much more.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3><a name="My_Computer_Can_Do_More_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>My Computer Can Do More?</h3>
            <p>That brings us to the point we want to make. The computer is a powerful tool that may not be being used to its full potential. That’s where software comes in. Software programs are the different “hats” that your computer can wear to help you do things.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> turns your computer into a customer relationship management tool. Other software programs allow you to design illustrations, navigate the internet, manage your accounting information, write books or even print information on worldwide destinations. The list of things that software programs can do continues to grow and grow. Many of them can be running along with your GDS simultaneously, and with a simple click of the mouse on your task bar, you can move among them. All of this can be a great benefit to you at work, but it starts with you being open to a new way of working and to new tools that may help you do your job better -- even make your job easier.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3><a name="What_is_ClientBase_Online_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>What is ClientBase Online?</h3>

            <p>Take these steps to set up <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> in IE v11 or above:</p>

            <p>Here is a good little tip for agencies that are launching CBO from outside of Sabre. Create a shortcut on the desktop for the purpose of launching CBO (rather than going to <a href="http://www.clientbaseonline.com/">www.clientbaseonline.com</a> each time). Right-mouse click on the desktop and click <span class="span_2" style="font-weight: bold;">Create New | Shortcut</span> , add the URL <b>http://www.clientbaseonline.com/login/</b> and save.<br />Launch CBO now with the desktop shortcut!</p>
            <p><span><b>Note</b>: </span>There is enhanced password login security for <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Online so that if a user fails to enter the correct password after three attempts, the user is locked out for 30 minutes. <br />After three failed attempts the user is prompted with the message: <span class="span_2">Your account has been locked for 30 minutes due to too many unsuccessful login attempts.</span> If logged out and the user needs access before the 30 minute timeframe is complete, an administrative user can change the password to clear the lock.</p>
            <p><span><b>Note</b>:</span> There is a warning message alerting users that the session is about to end. After being idle in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> for thirty minutes you will receive the message, <span class="span_2">Your ClientBase session will time out in 10 minutes and return to the home page if there is no additional activity. If you are still working in your session click OK to continue.</span> If the OK to continue is not clicked the session will end and take you back to the home page.</p>

            <p>The login page for <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> has a linked called <span class="span_2">Forgot my User Name/Password</span>. If an agent has forgotten either their <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Login or Password, they can click this link and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> will generate a new, unique CB password and email to the agent accordingly.<br />For this feature to work as designed each User Login must be configured with proper email settings and each User Login record must have a unique email address captured so that <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> can verify what email address this login information can be sent to.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Setup</b>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>1) Log into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> as SYSDBA and setup User Logins for each user, following the directions below. Make sure the default email client is set to SMTP and enter SMTP email settings. These settings are needed in order for CB to send an email with login information automatically. </p>

            <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> has a centralized database which means that all branches associated with the agency are included within one database. The program comes with 1000 branch records and for reporting purposes, this feature makes it extremely convenient to analyze the database by branch entries. Each client and agent profile has a field where the branch number can be entered. This entry is not a mandatory field in the client and agent profile, but we do suggest it be linked to the agent profile if possible. </p>
            <p>Branches can be added and deleted.&#160; A branch cannot be deleted if there is a profile, res card, invoice or payment record assigned to it.&#160; Branch numbers of deleted branches can be re-used.&#160; All newly added branches are added to the end of the list of branches, even if they are reusing a number from a deleted branch that used to be higher up. </p>
            <p>The order of branches can be changed by dragging the grey branch number box up or down on the Branch Settings screen. This sort order is shared by all Trams products.</p>

To have it appear like this, type <span>Joyce Smith&lt;joyce@Sabre.com&gt;</span> instead of just <span>joyce@sabre.com</span>. You can also use your company name or department name; for example, <span>Travel With the Stars&lt;sales@TWTS.com&gt; </span>or <span>Star Travel Marketing&lt;sales@TWTS.com&gt;.</span></p>

Perhaps you already have a service on port 25, and you do not want the services to conflict over the port assignment. In such a case, enter the port <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> should use. </p>
            <p>The default port for encrypted connections is 465 and unencrypted is 25. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> will automatically set the port to these defaults when choosing a Secure Connection setting. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Authentication Type:</span> Set to <span class="span_2">Default</span>, a setting used to authenticate your connection to the SMTP mail server by forcing a USER name and password. </p>

            <p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) is quickly becoming the common standard for encrypting emails. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor to TLS.

            <p>Agencies may use many different software programs to maintain customer data such as names, addresses, phone numbers and marketing information. Ideally, most agencies implementing <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> prefer to electronically "import" customer information to the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profiles rather than manually re-entering it. Later, when the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database is up and running, agencies may want to import other miscellaneous electronic files as well, such as a purchased mailing list. Although <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> can't anticipate every possible program used, if your agency has a database of customer information in a program that can put that information into an ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) file (.txt), chances are an electronic "import" is possible...and easy! </p>

            <p>The <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> import utility can only import tab or comma delimited ASCII text files. This means that the file you are importing must be saved in .txt format and use a carriage return between each profile record, and either a tab or comma between each field within each record. If the file you would like to import is not in this format, use a program like Excel to open the file and then save in .txt format.</p>

            <p>A wizard steps the user through the following steps making it very simple to map the fields included in the ASCII file to the profile fields included in a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile. All profiles imported via the Import feature are appended to any existing profiles within your current database. (The import feature does not currently update existing profiles.)</p>

            <p>If you have Marketing Entries to map or for which to set a constant, click <span class="span_2">Add Marketing Code. </span>Choose the marketing table you want to use. Notice two buttons that are used to describe how that data can be imported.</p>
            <p><span>Map:</span> Mapping is used when a data field exists and is populated in the file while importing. You want to bring the data in "as is" to a field in the database. Select the name of the field that exists in the source file from the drop-down,</p>
            <p><span>Constant:</span> Use this feature when using the same value for every profile being imported. </p>
            <p><span>Reset:</span> Click to reset any mapping or constant value for that field. </p>
            <p>Make sure to save each mapping or constant value. Repeat this process for each <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> field you want to populate. After mapping or setting your constant for each field click <span class="span_2">Next </span>to continue.</p>
            <p><span>Step</span><span>7:</span><span>Map Profile Remarks</span>
            </p>
            <p>If you have remarks of additional fields that you have not found a place for, click <span class="span_2">Add Remark. </span>By default the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> remarks field is selected. Notice two buttons that are used to describe how that data can be imported.</p>
            <p><span>Map:</span> Mapping is used when a data field exists and is populated in the file while importing. You want to bring the data in "as is" to a field in the database. Select the name of the field that exists in the source file from the drop-down,</p>
            <p><span>Constant:</span> Use this feature when using the same value for every profile being imported. </p>
            <p><span>Reset:</span> Click to reset any mapping or constant value for that field. </p>
            <p>Make sure to save each mapping or constant value. Repeat this process for each <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> field you want to populate. After mapping or setting your constant for each field click <span class="span_2">Next </span>to continue.</p>
            <p><span>Step 8: Review Summary and Import your records. </span>Upon completing the wizard's 7 steps above, click the Finish button and the summary page will display a message "Importing profiles. Please wait." When this message disappears, the import is complete and you can scroll to the bottom of the summary page to view the number of profiles successfully imported.</p>

            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>When creating new profiles in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> you have the ability to default a value into the following fields: Courtesy Title, City, State, Zip, Country, Salutation, Interface ID. Use the settings within this area to identify the defaults for your agency.</p>
            <p><span>Courtesy Title/Zip Code/City/State/Country/Salutation: </span>A default value can be assigned by selecting from the drop-down for these areas.</p>
            <p><span>InterfaceID:</span> In the InterfaceID area, choose from the drop-down menu a format for generating the default Interface ID.</p>
            <p>&lt;Area Code&gt;&lt;Prefix&gt;&lt;Suffix&gt; or</p>
            <p>&lt;Last Name&gt;&lt;First Name&gt;&lt;Agent Name&gt; or</p>
            <p>&lt;PROFILENO&gt; or</p>
            <p>&lt;GENERATOR&gt; with starting number set by agency, therefore allowing for sequential Interface ID numbering to go as high as 9,999,999,999, or </p>
            <p>&lt;MASK&gt;: The Interface ID you are generating in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> can be based on the Full Name field, First Name field, Last Name field, the Residential Phone field, or a combination of the all those fields (from 1-10 alpha-numeric characters). N uses a character from the name field, F uses a character from the first name field, L uses a character from the last name field, and a digit uses that position from the residential phone field (0 signifies the 10th digit of the phone number). Select a sample mask from the drop-down menu or create any mask that you desire. We recommend using the Interface ID mask of NNN4567890 which uses the first 3 letters of the client's last name, and the last 7 digits of the client's phone number. (If no phone number exists, an Interface ID is generated with just the first 3 characters of the client's last name.) </p>
            <p><span>Sample</span><span>Masks:</span>
            </p>
            <p>Mask Name field Phone field InterfaceID</p>

            <p>NN-4567890 SMITH/JOHN +1 (310) 987-6543 SM-9876543</p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> Characters from the name, first name, and last name fields are taken from left to right. Slashes and spaces are skipped. Any characters that is not an "N", not an "F", not an "L", and not a digit from "0" to "9" are treated as a constant. See last two samples above where "-" is in the mask. </p>
            <p><span>Require Unique, Non Blank I/F ID On New Profiles:</span> If this box is checked, you will NOT be able to create a "new" profile if the Interface ID field of the profile being created is an Interface ID that has already been used for an existing profile in the system.</p>

Perhaps you want to create a pull-down menu for special services such as “meet and greet” or “wheelchair assist.” Social security numbers or driver’s license numbers can be stored here or any other information that does not fit into one of the other pre-designed fields. </p>
            <p>Fields stored in the More Fields tab include a field name and an optional drop-down list of defaults entries. More field categories is where to assign a field name. Go to <span>Tool|Settings|User-Defined Fields|More Field Items</span> to create the drop-down list of defaults. (<span>Hint:</span> Make a More Field inactive.&#160; When it is made inactive, it is not displayed on the More Fields tab of profiles or res cards, and will not print on invoices. Inactive More Fields are still available for use in Res Card and Profile queries, as well as Global Modify. If the More Field was set as Required or Optional, it will no longer be required or optional once made inactive. More Fields must be unlinked from UDIDs and/or other More Fields before being made inactive.)</p>

            <p class="p_2">- Letters and Numbers Only</p>
            <p>A different format option can be selected for each Profile More Field. A field length can also be set for a More Field by entering the number of characters allowed in the Max Length field. Maximum number of characters for a More Field is 80 characters. These formatting options can only be used when adding new Profile More Field categories. Existing Profile More Field categories cannot be formatted.</p>
            <p>When a Profile More field is formatted, when entering a value for the More Field, the value can only be entered using the format designated for that category. If an incorrect value is entered a message is displayed informing you of the proper format. So if the More Field was formatted to accept numbers only and an alpha character is entered into the field, the message would appear, <span class="span_2">Invalid Entry. Format Type is Numbers Only.</span></p>

This reduces the number of hits and potentially the delay created by transmitting each line separately. Please note that Sabre only allows 30 entries strung together in one transmission, so depending on the number of entries included in a given merge to PNR, the entries may be broken into multiple transmissions.</p>
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traveler Name Format:</span> Customize the default name format to add a middle initial, middle name, or remove the courtesy title etc. In addition to being able to use any of these merge fields, <span class="span_2">Courtesy Title, First Name, Last Name, Middle Initial, Middle Name, No. of Travelers,</span> and <span class="span_2">Find the character, </span>there is also a checkbox called <span class="span_2">Combine same Last Name entries</span> which allows you to set whether common name entries appear as one or many name entries.</p>

An example of this is <span class="span_2">Courtesy Title</span>. If the field is completed, you want it included; but if it’s not, you don’t want to include the formatting with a blank space. To handle this, PNR rules uses left and right brackets <span>[ ]</span> to surround a set of characters within a rule, and designate that if the merge field within those brackets is blank, then don’t include any of the characters between the brackets.</p>

            <p>Merge to PNR Rules allow you to customize how data stored within your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profiles gets formatted for each GDS upon using the Merge to PNR feature. From the Merge to PNR Rules area, first select the desired Reservation System (Amadeus, Apollo, Galileo, Sabre or Worldspan). Once selected, a listing of all current PNR Rules is displayed.

            <p><span>2. Field Groups:</span> Select the type of profile data you want to format for your GDS PNR’s. Click the arrow located to the right of this field to select from a drop-down list of choices. Each field group includes a designated list of profile fields available for use within a PNR rule. These profile fields appear in the <span class="span_2">Available Fields</span> area when the field group is selected. Available field groups include <span class="span_2">Primary Address, Bill to Address, Ship to Address, Secondary Address, Alternate Address, Phone, Fax, Email, Traveler Miscellaneous, Credit Card, Frequent Flier, Hotel Program, Other Cards, Car Program, Miscellaneous, User Login, Primary Agent, Profile Mixed Fields</span> (create a rule with combination of merge fields)<span class="span_2">, Branch </span>and <span class="span_2">Res Card Invoice.</span></p>
            <p><span>3. Always Move This Rule:</span> When checked, this field sets the rule to always move this entry into a PNR; left unchecked, the entry is optional.</p>
            <p><span>4. Display on Selection Screen:</span> Within each PNR entry or PNR rule that is set as <span class="span_2">Always Move This Rule</span>, an option is included called display on selection screen. The PNR selection screen is the first screen that appears when you merge to PNR, and allows you to select the specific profile data to be included and sent to the current PNR. For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this <span class="span_2">Display on Selection Screen</span> can be unchecked so that the first selection screen is less complicated for the agent to review. These unchecked rules now appear on the second <span class="span_2">Additional Entries</span> screen in the merge to PNR, and are automatically moved into the PNR.</p>
            <p><span>5. PNR Custom Rules:</span> Enter the exact format to be entered in the PNR when this rule is selected using the combination of free-flow text, special characters, and merge fields from the list of available fields. Refer to your current scripts, GDS format guide and back office format documentation to create the custom rule. </p>

            <h4><a name="Handling_Blank_Merge_Fields" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Handling Blank Merge Fields</h4>
            <p>When setting up rules, you may choose to include merge fields that aren’t always completed in every profile. Such fields include <span class="span_2">Courtesy Title, Apt/Suite, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Company Name</span>. If the field is completed, you want it included; but if it’s not, you don’t want to include the formatting with a blank space. To handle this, the PNR rules uses left and right brackets <span>[ ]</span> to surround a set of characters within a rule, and designate that if the merge field within those brackets is blank, then don’t include any of the characters between the brackets. Here’s an example:</p>
            <p>The brackets around <span>[5/&lt;&lt;CompanyName&gt;&gt;§]</span> suggest that if this is an leisure profile so the <span class="span_2">Company Name Merge Field</span> is blank, then don’t include the 5/ or end item formatting either.</p>

            <h3><a name="Auto-Case_Converter_Settings" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor49"></a>Auto-Case Converter Settings</h3>
            <p>Within this area a listing of the following profile fields is available for automatic case handling: <span class="span_2">Name, First Name, Last Name, Courtesy Title, Address 1, Address 2, Apt/Suite, City, Country, Traveler First Name, Traveler Last Name, Traveler Courtesy Title, </span>and <span class="span_2">Traveler Relationship/Title. </span>By placing a check into any of these fields, as you are working within your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profiles, the first letter of each word entered will be automatically capitalized and the remaining letters will be automatically set to lower case. If you would like the auto-case converter turned off for any of these fields, remove the check from the box preceding the field.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 1 cbo intro and setup1/live connect_16.jpg" style="height: 360px;width: 405px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBO27/images/CBOIntroSetup.02.1.33.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>To override the system's automatic case handling for entries such as McLeod or NE (where the auto case handling reverts to Mcleod and Ne), tab past the field then move back into it (by using &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;), as the automatic case handling is turned off for a field once entries exist within it. Another option is to enter McLeod as Mc Leod and NE as N.E., since spaces and punctuation allow for capitalization. </p>
            <p><span>Tip:</span> If you have many profiles that have already been created by solid caps or all lower case letters, use the Case Converter in <span class="span_2">Tools</span> to convert these first before setting this up.</p>

            <p>A formatting toolbar is included that makes formatting your text, inserting links, pictures and tables very easy. <span>Please note</span> this HTML formatting is only included when the template is launched via Merge to Email. All Templates launched through the Merge to Doc Template feature are converted to Plain Text upon converting to MS Word.</p>
            <p><span>Note to </span><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span><span> Window Users: </span>Document Templates are shared across <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span><span class="span_2">Online</span>and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Windows and changes made in either are reflected and can be launched in both. Please note one very important difference between Document Templates created/modified in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Windows and Document Templates created/modified in <span class="span_2">ClientBase Online (or Browser)</span>. The Windows version saves Document Templates as rtf (Rich Text Format), which means the text can be formatted with different fonts and color etc. and that graphics can be inserted. Since web applications do not utilize rtf (HTML editing will be coming soon), <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> has to open any existing Document Template and convert to txt (Plain Text). Therefore if a Document Template is created or modified in the Windows version and then modified in the Browser version, the Browser version will convert it to plain text (stripping all formatting and graphics) and save it as plain text. </p>
            <p>To avoid losing formatting features within Document Templates created in the Windows version, we prompt with a warning message before overwriting an rtf Document Template with plain text. If you utilize formatting within your Document Templates then we recommend you make all changes to existing Templates through the Windows version and only add new Templates via the Browser version. </p>

            <p>Res Card More Fields are used for capturing any type of trip data that the Res Card currently is not prompting for, giving you the ultimate flexibility in tracking trip information. Res Card More Fields can be linked to a <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> UDID (User Defined Interface Data) field too, so upon invoicing in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, the more field entry automatically populates the appropriate TBO UDID field. When setting up the Res Card More Fields, you have the ability to link a Profile More Field to a Res Card More Field which means upon creating a new Res Card, the Res Card More Field automatically is completed with the entry in the profile more field. </p>
            <p>This means if certain client data is being captured in a profile more field and being merged into a PNR via the PNR rules for the purpose of completing a TBO UDID, you can invoice from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and automatically complete that data into any new Res Cards, and upon invoicing complete the TBO UDID with no extra steps. </p>
            <p>Setup Res Card More Fields categories and items by following these steps: </p>
            <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
                <li class="ListParagraph" value="1">Go to More Field Categories to assign a field name by going to <span>Settings|Res Card More Field Categories</span>, and complete the following fields: </li>

            <p>From this area you have the ability to <span class="span_2">Turn on Insurance Waiver Prompts</span> for both invoices and itineraries. When these settings are checked, upon issuing an invoice or itinerary, agents are prompted if no insurance exists within the Res Card's reservations (including itemization and Service Provider records).

            <p>Add or update global level Headers and Footers for Invoices and Trip Proposals directly from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. These Headers and Footers can be used to set your page margins, recreate your agency letterhead and standardize your Invoices and Trip Proposals through the use of customizable Text, Graphics and Merge Fields. Agencies with multiple branches have the option of setting up just one global header/footer and use the branch merge fields for customization by branch. </p>
            <p>Go to <span>Tools|Settings|Headers and Footers</span> to update or create your agency level Headers and Footers. (Invoices and Trip Proposal Headers and Footers must be set up separately.) </p>

            <p>Click the desired tab to setup the headers and footers. The report header is the header on the first page of the report; the report footer is the footer on the last page in the report. The page header is for each page of the report, and the page footer is for each page of the report. If you have a Report Header/Footer and Page Header/Footer all setup, each prints on each of the pages you designate. </p>
            <p><span>Add Text:</span> Use Add Text to insert text into the header or footer. A text box appears in the upper left corner. Size it and move it by using the 2-directional and 4-directional arrows. To type and format text, double-click the text box. A screen appears to enter your desired text, align the text, add merge fields (see below), and set the font. Click OK to go back to the main screen. </p>
            <p><span>Add Picture:</span> Use Add Picture File to insert a graphic file. Use the browse feature to locate the graphic file on any drive/directory and click Open once located. (Use *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.bmp, *.ico, and *.emf type graphic files within headers and footers.) Double-click the graphic to access dialog box to set size and page alignment, or highlight the graphic to click and drag, size, and position it properly. <span>Tip:</span> Make sure the graphic is properly sized before importing it. </p>
            <p><span>Add RTF:</span> An rtf box provides slightly more formatting than a text box. Notice the formatting toolbar and merge fields. </p>

            <p><span>Note:</span> Res Card Bill To and Res Card Ship To merge fields appear in the text box as one line, but when merged can take up to 5 lines of address information, so be sure provide a large enough text box when using these merge fields. </p>

            <p>Logos can be added to Headers and Footers at the user level for use on Invoices, Itineraries, Trip Proposals, Trip Statements and Receipts. Some agencies have the need for an agent to have his or her own unique branding to appear on Invoice, Statements, etc. (such as agents that are Independent Contractors). To use the agent logo feature, it is necessary to add the agent's logo to the Agent's profile and to add the <span class="span_2">Primary Agent Logo</span> merge field to Headers and Footers.</p>
            <p>The agent's user login must be associated with an agent profile. Verify that the Agent Profile field is completed in the user login settings. If Agent Profile is missing from the user profile, the SYSDBA user must login and complete it. (<span>Tools|Settings|User Logins.</span>) </p>
            <p>Next, query and select the agent profile, click the Attachments tab and <span class="span_2">Add</span>. There are two Attachment Types of Logo and General (for attachments other than logos). Select Logo, then Browse for Attachment and select the agent's logo image. Agent's logo image must be a *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.bmp, *.ico, or *.emf type graphic file. Make sure it's the correct size before you import it. Complete the Description field and click OK to save.</p>

            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>After saving the agent logo, select the desired Header and Footer (Invoice, Trip Proposal, Receipt, etc.). Double-click on the global logo image to open the Picture Designer. Do not change the current logo image. Click the down arrow on the <span class="span_2">Merge Field</span>, select Primary Agent Logo from the drop down and click OK to save. </p>

            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Repeat these steps to add the Primary Agent Logo merge field to each Header and Footer (Invoice, Trip Proposal, Receipt, etc.).</p>
            <p>If a logo exists in the Agent Profile, that logo is merged on to the document as long as the Primary Agent Logo merge field is in the Header and Footer. If no logo exists in the Agent Profile, or if the agent's user login does not have an assigned Agent Profile, the agency's usual Header and Footer is used (Branch level or the Global level).</p>

            <p>Database administrators can designate certain fields within a Profile, Activity or Res Card record as a mandatory field that must be completed for the record to be saved. By default no fields in a Profile, Activity or Res Card are set as mandatory, but by going into and selecting the record type, set any field as either Required, which means you cannot save the record without completing this field; or as Optional which means you get a prompt when saving the record and if this field is left blank, the system still saves the record. </p>
            <p>

            <p><span>Note: </span>The Traveler tab in Profile Required Fields helps track traveler information for TSA Requirements. Information needed to meet TSA Requirements such as Gender, Middle Name, and Birth Date (day, month and year) are located under a new traveler section under <span>Tools|Settings|Required/Optional Fields</span>. Other fields which can be set to Required or Optional are Relationship, Courtesy Title, First Name, Last Name, Citizenship, Primary Passport Number, Primary Passport Issue Date, Primary Passport Issue City and Primary Passport Expiration. After adding or editing a traveler record and saving it, prompting will occur if any of the required/optional fields are missing information.</p>
            <p class="p_4">When using Required fields for Birthday Month, Birthday Day and Birthday Year: </p>
            <p>**If Birthday Day is required or optional, the Birthday Month is set to Required. </p>
            <p>**If Birthday Year is required or optional, the Birthday Month and Birthday Day will be set to Required.</p>
            <p>**If Birthday Month is not Required, then both Birthday Day and Birthday Year will be cleared.</p>
