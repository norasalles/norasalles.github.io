            <h1><a name="Introduction_..94" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction </h1>
            <p class="p_4">This section provides a general overview of ClientBase Online, how it fits into agency operations, what it is, and what it can do for your agency and front-line agents. It also outlines the steps you need to successfully implement your new program.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h2><a name="How_Does_ClientBase_Online_Fit_In_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>How Does ClientBase Online Fit In?</h2>
            <p class="p_4">Look around your desk. What do you see? Pictures of family, a phone, a calendar from one of the cruise lines, facial tissue. But wait! What’s that behind all those Post-it notes? It’s a computer! In most cases, it was put there as a terminal for a Computer Reservation System (CRS), or as it’s now called, Global Distribution System (GDS). If you are like many agents, you use it to book travel for clients and to find information on airfares, seats, hotel rooms, car rentals, etc. You may even use it to handle e-mail and browse the web, but not much more.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h2><a name="My_Computer_Can_Do_More_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>My Computer Can Do More?</h2>
            <p class="p_4">That brings us to the point we want to make. The computer is a powerful tool that may not be being used to its full potential. That’s where software comes in. Software programs are the different “hats” that your computer can wear to help you do things.</p>
            <p class="p_4">ClientBase turns your computer into a customer relationship management tool. Other software programs allow you to design illustrations, navigate the internet, manage your accounting information, write books or even print information on worldwide destinations. The list of things that software programs can do continues to grow and grow. Many of them can be running along with your GDS simultaneously, and with a simple click of the mouse on your task bar, you can move among them. All of this can be a great benefit to you at work, but it starts with you being open to a new way of working and to new tools that may help you do your job better -- even make your job easier.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h2><a name="What_is_ClientBase_Online_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>What is ClientBase Online?</h2>
            <p class="p_4">ClientBase is a tool for selling travel. It’s an easy-to-use marketing database system developed specifically for travel agents.

            <h2><a name="It’s_About_Building_and_Maintaining_Relationships" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>It’s About Building and Maintaining Relationships</h2>
            <p class="p_4">ClientBase organizes all the client information you decide is relevant for marketing, and gives you an easy way to access that information quickly. From the outside, ClientBase is a powerful tool designed to help you sell travel to people. Inside, you will find key features that assist you in building and maintaining lasting relationships with your clients, while providing contact management and an automated Res Card system.</p>
            <p class="p_4">You know how important it is to maintain a good relationship with your clients, especially if you are a travel professional specializing in leisure travel. You succeed by creating a bond, building trust and by matching the right travel products and services with your customers. However, keeping track of the increasing quantity of leisure travelers and complexity of travel packages is a difficult task. You need an easy-to-use tool that allows you to access the pertinent information you have stored for every client. ClientBase is that tool. </p>

            <p class="p_4">Before agents can use ClientBase Online, some setup needs to be completed by the database administrator in ClientBase Online or in ClientBase Windows if you are using that version of ClientBase with ClientBase Online. All setup except entering invoice numbers and password resets need to be done in ClientBase Windows if you are using that program together with ClientBase Online. If you are not using ClientBase Windows together with ClientBase Online, all setup is done within the ClientBase Online program.</p>

                    <p>Single Sign On with Sabre Red Workspace will not work in version 4.01.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>As always, if you use both ClientBase Windows and ClientBase Online, you must change your password in both. Passwords do not sync between these products.&#160; </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p_4">ClientBase Online requires Microsoft Internet Explorer version 11 or greater. Do not use any other browser. For this reason, the first time you log into the program you must run the ClientBase Diagnostics to make sure it passes all areas. </p>
            <p class="p_4">Take these steps to set up ClientBase in IE v11 or above:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="p_4">1) When the Internet Explorer window displays more than the IE toolbar, such as the Google toolbar, both toolbars must disable pop-ups in order to generate invoices within the ClientBase product.</p>
                <p class="p_4">2) Also, depending upon your Internet Explorer settings, you may be prompted for User Login Authentication information. </p>
                <p class="p_4">3) You are prompted for User Login Authentication information. <br /><br />- To remove this prompt: Go to <i style="font-weight: bold;">Tools | Security</i> and <i>Trusted site</i>s.

            <p class="p_4">Here is a good little tip for agencies that are launching CLIENTBASE ONLINE from outside of Sabre. Create a shortcut on the desktop for the purpose of launching ClientBase Online (rather than going to <a href="http://www.clientbaseonline.com/">www.clientbaseonline.com</a> each time). Right-mouse click on the desktop and click <i style="font-weight: bold;">Create New | Shortcut</i>, add the URL <b>http://www.clientbaseonline.com/login/</b> and <i style="font-weight: bold;">save</i>.<br /> Launch ClientBase Online now with the desktop shortcut!</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="p_4"><b>Note</b>: There is enhanced password login security for ClientBase Online so that if a user fails to enter the correct password after three attempts, the user is locked out for 30 minutes. After three failed attempts the user is prompted with the message: “Your account has been locked for 30 minutes due to too many unsuccessful login attempts.” If logged out and the user needs access before the 30-minute timeframe is complete, an administrative user can change the password to clear the lock.</p>
                <p class="p_4"><b>Note</b>: There is a warning message alerting users that the session is about to end. After being idle in ClientBase Online for ten minutes you will receive the message “Your ClientBase session will time out in 10 minutes and return to the home page if there is no additional activity. If you are still working in your session click OK to continue.” If the OK to continue is not clicked the session will end and take you back to the home page.</p>

            <h3><a name="Forgot_My_Login_Name_Password" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Forgot My Login Name/Password</h3>
            <p class="p_4">The login page for ClientBase Online has a link called Forgot my Login Name/Password. If an agent has forgotten either their ClientBase Online Login Name or Password, they can click this link and ClientBase Online will generate a new, unique password and email the temporary password to the agent accordingly. For this feature to work as designed, each User Login must be configured with proper email settings and each User Login record must have a unique email address captured so that ClientBase can verify what email address this login information can be sent to.</p>
            <h4 class="Heading5"><a name="Setup" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Setup</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p class="p_4">1) Log into ClientBase Online as SYSDBA and setup User Logins for each user by following the directions below. Make sure the default email client is set to SMTP and enter SMTP email settings. These settings are needed in order for ClientBase Online to send an email with login information automatically. </p>
                <p class="p_4">2) Verify that each User Login record has a valid email address within the User Settings link. This is the email that a forgotten login or password can be sent to. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <h4 class="Heading5"><a name="Using_This_Feature" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Using This Feature</h4>
            <p class="p_4">When a user logs into ClientBase Online, if the system detects that the user's e-mail address was not completed in the user profile, the user is prompted to add it. In order for all user logins to have an e-mail address when the Forgot my Login Name/Password feature is used, upon login if an e-mail address is missing from the user profile a screen appears with the message: “E-mail address was not entered in this user's login settings. Please enter e-mail address.” Below the message is a box to enter the e-mail address, then click Save.</p>
            <p class="p_4">If an agent has forgotten the login or password, they can click Forgot my Login Name/Password link on the ClientBase Online login page. As an added layer of security, a PCC in also required when a using the forgot password feature. When the Forgot my Login Name/Password link is clicked, the forgot password screen is displayed with the message “ClientBase Online will locate your User Login based on e-mail address and PCC, then reset your password and e-mail it to you.” The e-mail and PCC fields are also displayed. Enter the e-mail address and PCC and click Send. The message is then displayed, “Your password has been reset and an email with your User Name and new password has been sent to the email address provided.” Next, check your e-mail and login in using the temporary password sent. After logging in with the temporary password immediately you will be prompted to change it for security purposes.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="p_4">If an invalid e-mail and/or PCC for your user login is entered, upon clicking send you are prompted, “The e-mail address and PCC you entered does not match to any existing User Login. Please contact your database administrator.”</p>

            <p class="p_4">ClientBase has a centralized database which means that all branches associated with the agency are included within one database. The program comes with 1000 branch records and for reporting purposes, this feature makes it extremely convenient to analyze the database by branch entries. Each client and agent profile has a field where the branch number can be entered. This entry is not a mandatory field in the client and agent profile, but we do suggest it be linked to the agent profile if possible. </p>
            <p class="p_4">Branches can be added and deleted.&#160; A branch cannot be deleted if there is a profile, res card, invoice or payment record assigned to it.&#160; Branch numbers of deleted branches can be re-used.&#160; All newly added branches are added to the end of the list of branches, even if they are reusing a number from a deleted branch that used to be higher up. </p>
            <p class="p_4">The order of branches can be changed by dragging the grey branch number box up or down on the Branch Settings screen. This sort order is shared by all Trams products.</p>

The address entered here appears as the from address for all emails sent from this user. If you wish to change this address frequently, do so at the email level when you are sending it out.<br />In the From E-Mail field, if you type joyce@sabre.com and a message is sent, you see the From field saying joyce@sabre.com. Some people prefer it to look like this instead, Joyce Smith. To have it appear like this, type Joyce Smith&lt;joyce@Sabre.com&gt; instead of just joyce@sabre.com.

            <p class="p_4"><b>Port</b>: This setting defines the TCP/IP port which your email application listens on for incoming mail. If left blank, this setting uses port 25 by default, which is the Internet standard for receiving SMTP mail. In some situations, you may have chosen to move the SMTP service to another port. Perhaps you already have a service on port 25, and you do not want the services to conflict over the port assignment. In such a case, enter the port ClientBase should use. <br />The default port for encrypted connections is 465 and unencrypted is 25. ClientBase will automatically set the port to these defaults when choosing a Secure Connection setting. </p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Authentication Type</b>: Set to Default, a setting used to authenticate your connection to the SMTP mail server by forcing a user name and password. <br />None: If your agency is hosting your own email server and the network login has been configured to handle the authentication to the SMTP Server automatically, set this field to None. </p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>E-Mail Account Login and Password</b>: Use when Login Type is set to Default. Enter your E-Mail account login and password here.<br />Secure Connection: The Merge to Email feature supports SSL/TLS secure connections. A drop-down enables you to select from four options: None, TLS (if available), TLS, and SSL. </p>
            <p class="p_4">The type of connection you select is determined by the type of security supported by your email provider or Internet Service Provider (ISP). Please contact your ISP to find out which setting is correct for your email account.</p>

            <p class="p_4">The Marketing Tables in a profile are used to identify each of your customer’s unique travel preferences, interests and demographics, while at the same time, automatically grouping clients with common codes. Since qualifying a customer for a leisure vacation can be the most difficult part of selling leisure travel, access to this valuable information might just make the difference between closing a sale or losing it.</p>
            <p class="p_4">These marketing tables make it possible to consistently put the right product in front of the right client, by both your front-line agents and marketing programs geared towards generating travel interest. In addition, labels, letters and e-mails can be quickly created to link clients and travel preferences when a “hot” travel special lands on your desk. With a simple mouse click, every agent selects from the same list, and that means continuity among your clients and simplicity for your agents.</p>
            <p class="p_4">All customer profiles have profile link called&#160;Marketing&#160;Codes which contain marketing tables. Some of these tables come with pre-defined default codes, but all of them can be customized to meet agency needs. There is no limit to the number of marketing tables that an agency can have; however, it is important to remember that for reporting purposes, it may become very difficult to see the true client traveling preferences if too many categories exist. For example, if you have both&#160;ancient sites&#160;and&#160;archeological digs&#160;as marketing categories, you might miss several clients who would be interested in a tour to an archeological dig if the report only includes clients from the&#160;archeological sites&#160;marketing category.</p>
            <p class="p_4">If you are a member of an agency consortium that has provided its own default market categories and codes within&#160;ClientBase, check with the consortium before making any changes to the defaults (or add your own tables and codes directly below the defaulted tables).</p>

            <p class="p_4">To ensure that travel insurance protection is offered to every customer and either accepted or declined, setup&#160;Res Card Insurance Prompting. If activated, this feature looks for any insurance reservations at the time of generating an invoice or itinerary. This feature also looks for insurance in itemization and Service Provider records.&#160; If none exists, the system prompts with a message:&#160;"No Insurance Reservations Exist for this trip. Accept or Decline Insurance."&#160;Declining insurance then includes an agency-defined waiver message for printing at the bottom of the invoice or itinerary.</p>
            <p class="p_4">Accepting insurance takes the agent to a new reservation, defaulting the travel category to insurance and the vendor to the agency defined default insurance vendor, for capturing an insurance booking. (ClientBase&#160;now Live Connects to several insurance companies - see&#160;An In-Depth Look at Live Connect&#160;to setup.)</p>

            <p class="p_4">ClientBase Res Card reservations have the ability to capture up to 4 different Tax Rates/Codes and a Commission. These settings establish the default rates when a new reservation is first created. These defaults can be overridden on a reservation-by-reservation basis. If you are not a TBO user, designate which taxes go to which tax fields when invoicing from ClientBase. The commission rate for vendors used in reservations is defaulting to the vendor commission field in the vendor profile. If the vendor default commission is blank, then the commission defaults to the amount entered in the field called Comm Rate. </p>
            <p class="p_4">Hint: If you want to fill in taxes and commissions on a reservation-by-reservation basis, leave blank.</p>

            <p class="p_4">Note: There is a setting in the General Tab, Include GST/HST Rate for agencies in areas that use GST/HST but are not required to calculate taxes based on Province (the Caribbean), using this setting ignores the rates set up by Province under the Region Tax tab, but will instead use the Global rate entered as the default. Upon checking this box, a GST/HST Rate field is displayed. Enter the Global rate to be used in calculating the taxes.</p>

            <p class="p_4">Trip Balance Due Date:&#160; Select Earliest Reservation Final Payment Due Date or No Default. </p>
            <p class="p_4">A separate setting can be designated for each form of payment:&#160;Cash, Check, Credit Card and CC Merchant. Adding a check to the form of payment indicates that upon invoicing with that form of payment, the payment is automatically saved and applied to the invoice. Removing the check from the form of payment indicates that upon invoicing with that form of payment, the printed version of the invoice shows as paid, but the payment does not get saved to the database leaving the invoice and Client Balance open.</p>
            <p class="p_4">Tip for Non-Trams Back Office&#160;Users:&#160;By leaving all these forms of payments unchecked, you have ease when voiding out invoices that are incorrect since this area is designed for use with&#160;Trams Back Office.</p>

            <p class="p_4">Since many times an agent creates multiple reminders at one time after booking a reservation to help remember common tasks such as collecting deposit, final payment, checking for documents, sending welcome home letters, etc., you can create a global set of Batched Reminders that can be launched from within a Res Card to create multiple reminders all at one time.</p>
            <p class="p_4">Although you can add unlimited batches to this area, a default cruise/tour batch has been created for you which contains the reminders, Deposit Due, Final Payment Due, Validate Int’l Security Information, Send Gift, Check for Documents, and Welcome Home. To create a batch reminder:</p>
            <p class="p_4">1) Go to Tools | Settings | Batch Reminders. </p>
            <p class="p_4">2) Highlight the default Cruise/Tour Batched Reminder and click Edit on its right. </p>

            <p class="p_4"><b>Default Date Using</b>: From the drop-down menu, select Current Date, Res Card Create Date, Res Card Start Date, or Res Card Return Date. These Global Reminder settings need to use date entries as Merge fields so that upon launching the Batched Reminders from within a Res Card the appropriate Reminder Date can be defaulted. This defaulted date for the Reminder can be overwritten at the time of launching the Batched Reminders, just before Creating and Saving them to the Res Card Activities tab.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Plus/Minu</b>s: Select plus or minus from the drop-down</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Number of Days</b>: Enter a number from 1 to 2000</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Start Time</b>:&#160;Enter time you want alarm to start alerting you about this reminder.</p>

            <p class="p_4"><b>To-Do</b>:&#160;Check here if you do not want to set a specific time for this reminder.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Set Alarm</b>:&#160;To further assist with remembering important tasks,&#160;ClientBase&#160;reminders include an optional alarm. Like the alarm which awakens you each morning, the alarm activates at the time designated within the reminder (regardless of where you are in&#160;ClientBase, or any other program) as long as&#160;ClientBase&#160;is running on your PC. When an alarm is activated, a window appears that includes the details of the reminder along with three options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Off:&#160;Turns off the alarm but keeps the reminder open and on to-do list.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Snooze:&#160;Reschedules the alarm for a future time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>View:&#160;Allows you to work the reminder.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Tip</b>:&#160;It is suggested you do not set alarms for the agents’ batched reminders. Let each agent set these up for themselves when they launch the batch reminders in the Res Card. This saves them from being barraged with numerous alarms for each Res Card in which they have created reminders.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Create Reminde</b>r: From the drop-down menu, select&#160;Optional&#160;or&#160;Always.&#160;Upon launching batch reminders from a Res Card, a listing of default reminders appears. An&#160;Optional&#160;entry prompts you to "check off" the reminder before placing it into a Res Card; the&#160;Always&#160;entry is already "checked off" for you.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Reminder Type</b>:&#160;Enter the type of follow-up for the reminder by clicking the drop-down menu and picking from a customized list. Such types may include phone call, e-mail, letter, etc. Reminder types are user-defined and setup in&#160;Tools | Settings | User Defined Fields | Reminder Type.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Subject</b>:&#160;Enter the subject of the reminder by clicking the drop-down menu and picking from a user-defined list. Subjects are setup in&#160;Tools | Settings | User Defined Fields | Reminder Subject.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Priority</b>:&#160;Click the drop-down menu to tag this reminder with a priority level - high, medium, or low. The priority level can be used as search criteria in Advanced Search of the Activity Manager.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Login Name</b>:&#160;Defaults to the user logged into the system.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Private</b>:&#160;Check this box to make reminder private. Only the sign-in agent and SYSDBA can access the reminder.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><b>Remarks</b>:&#160;Enter any additional remarks or instructions in the text box at the bottom of the reminder entry screen.</p>
            <p class="p_4">6) Continue to add as many default Reminders as you would like included within this Batch of Reminders by repeating Step 5 above.</p>
            <p class="p_4">7) After each default Reminder is created for this batch, click Save Changes to save the Batch. Create more than one Batch of Reminders if desired. For example, if you would like different default Reminders for a Tour booking then for a Cruise booking, or for a particular Group booking, then add another Batch of Reminders accordingly.</p>
            <h4 class="Heading5"><a name="Host_Codes" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Host Codes</h4>
            <p class="p_4">If you are sending invoices to a Host agency and need to track reservations booked through the Host, you need to set Host Codes. To ensure continuity across reservations, this field is not free flow, but is populated by selecting from a drop-down list created in Tools | Settings | Host Codes. Use Add, Modify and Delete to customize your list of possible Host Codes. Go to Tools | Settings | Default Field Values for Res Cards and set a default Host Code for new Reservations if desired.</p>
            <p class="p_4">Once your Host Codes have been established, upon creating new Res Card Reservations, track the Host Code as desired. Upon generating an invoice for each reservation, the Host Code is saved within the invoice booking record accordingly. </p>

            <p class="p_4"><i>Send as one transmission</i>: If you check this setting, ClientBase strings together as many entries as it can into one transmission with the use of end items at the end of each line. This reduces the number of hits and potentially the delay created by transmitting each line separately. Please note that Sabre only allows 30 entries strung together in one transmission, so depending on the number of entries included in a given merge to PNR, the entries may be broken into multiple transmissions.</p>
            <p class="p_4"><i>Traveler Name Format</i>: Customize the default name format to add a middle initial, middle name, or remove the courtesy title etc. In addition to being able to use any of these merge fields, Courtesy Title, First Name, Last Name, Middle Initial, Middle Name, No. of Travelers, and Find the character, there is also a checkbox called ‘Combine same Last Name entries’ which allows you to set whether common name entries appear as one or many name entries.</p>
            <p class="p_4">To modify this default PNR Custom Rule, start with the same format you would type into your GDS, and select any Merge Field to include by clicking the field and Insert. You may choose to include merge fields that aren’t always completed in every profile. An example of this is Courtesy Title. If the field is completed, you want it included but if it’s not, you don’t want to include the formatting with a blank space. To handle this, PNR rules uses left and right brackets [ ] to surround a set of characters within a rule, and designate that if the merge field within those brackets is blank, then don’t include any of the characters between the brackets.</p>

            <p class="p_4">Merge to PNR Rules allow you to customize how data stored within your&#160;ClientBase&#160;profiles gets formatted for each GDS upon using the Merge to PNR feature. From the Merge to PNR Rules area, first select the desired Reservation System (Amadeus, Apollo, Galileo, Sabre or Worldspan). Once selected, a listing of all current PNR Rules is displayed.

            <p class="p_4">A rule is simply a way of designating how certain fields of information captured in a profile should be formatted when sent to a PNR.&#160;ClientBase&#160;comes defaulted with standard rules for each GDS, formatted for sending the following fields of profile data:</p>

For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this&#160;Display on Selection Screen&#160;can be unchecked so that the first selection screen is less complicated for the agent to review. These unchecked rules now appear on the second&#160;Additional Entries&#160;screen in the merge to PNR, and are automatically moved into the PNR.</p>
            <p>5. PNR Custom Rules:&#160;Enter the exact format to be entered in the PNR when this rule is selected using the combination of free-flow text, special characters, and merge fields from the list of available fields. Refer to your current scripts, GDS format guide and back office format documentation to create the custom rule.</p>

            <p>When setting up rules, you may choose to include merge fields that aren’t always completed in every profile. Such fields include&#160;Courtesy Title, Apt/Suite,&#160;or&#160;Company Name. If the field is completed, you want it included but if it’s not, you don’t want to include the formatting with a blank space. To handle this, the PNR rules uses left and right brackets&#160;[ ]&#160;to surround a set of characters within a rule, and designate that if the merge field within those brackets is blank, then don’t include any of the characters between the brackets. Here’s an example:</p>
            <p>The brackets around&#160;[5/&lt;&lt;CompanyName&gt;&gt;§]&#160;suggest that if this is a leisure profile so the&#160;Company Name Merge Field&#160;is blank, then don’t include the 5/ or end item formatting either.</p>

            <p class="p_4">Logos can be added to Headers and Footers at the user level for use on Invoices and Trip Proposals. Some agencies have the need for an agent to have his or her own unique branding to appear on an Invoice or Trip Proposal (such as agents that are Independent Contractors). To use the agent logo feature, it is necessary to add the agent's logo to the Agent's profile and to add the Primary Agent Logo merge field to Headers and Footers.</p>
            <p class="p_4">The agent's user login must be associated with an agent profile. Verify that the Agent Profile field is completed in the user login settings. If Agent Profile is missing from the user profile, the SYSDBA user must login and complete it. (Tools | Settings | User Logins.) </p>

            <p class="p_4">Select Logo, then Browse for Attachment and select the agent's logo image. Agent's logo image must be a *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.bmp, *.ico, or *.emf type graphic file. Make sure it's the correct size before you import it. Complete the Description field and click OK to save.</p>
            <p class="p_4">After saving the agent logo, select the desired Header and Footer (Invoice or Trip Proposal). Double-click on the global logo image to open the Picture Designer.

            <p class="p_4">Repeat these steps to add the Primary Agent Logo merge field to each Header and Footer</p>
            <p class="p_4">If a logo exists in the Agent Profile, that logo is merged on to the document as long as the Primary Agent Logo merge field is in the Header and Footer. If no logo exists in the Agent Profile, or if the agent's user login does not have an assigned Agent Profile, the agency's usual Header and Footer is used (Branch level or the Global level).</p>

The Windows version saves Document Templates as rtf (Rich Text Format), which means the text can be formatted with different fonts and color etc. and that graphics can be inserted. Since web applications do not utilize rtf (HTML editing will be coming soon), ClientBase has to open any existing Document Template and convert to txt (Plain Text). Therefore if a Document Template is created or modified in the Windows version and then modified in the Browser version, the Browser version will convert it to plain text (stripping all formatting and graphics) and save it as plain text. </p>

            <p class="p_4">Agencies may use many different software programs to maintain customer data such as names, addresses, phone numbers and marketing information. Ideally, most agencies implementing ClientBase Online prefer to electronically "import" customer information to the ClientBase Online profiles rather than manually re-entering it. Later, when the ClientBase Online is up and running, agencies may want to import other miscellaneous electronic files as well, such as a purchased mailing list. Although ClientBase Online can't anticipate every possible program used, if your agency has a database of customer information in a program that can put that information into an ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) file (.txt), chances are an electronic "import" is possible...and easy! </p>
            <p class="p_4">Only the Manager Authorization has permission to do a Profile Import. </p>
            <h3><a name="ASCII_Delimited_Text_Files" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>ASCII Delimited Text Files</h3>
            <p class="p_4">Regardless of the specific program used to maintain your database, if the program can create an ASCII-comma or tab delimited file (and most programs currently can by using&#160;File | Save As&#160;or&#160;File | Export), that file can be imported using the&#160;ClientBase Online&#160;Import Wizard. An ASCII format uses a standardized coding scheme enabling different computer programs to exchange information.</p>
            <p class="p_4">Each record in the file includes information such as Name, Address 1, Address 2, City, etc. To recognize when one field ends and another field begins, a&#160;delimiter&#160;is used, separating each field. This delimiter is a character and the most commonly used are a&#160;tab&#160;or a&#160;comma.</p>
            <p class="p_4">If your existing database program can create an ASCII file, create your file, and save it to an external source such as a flash drive or to your computer.&#160; The file must be created&#160;prior&#160;to running the&#160;ClientBase&#160;Import Wizard. Find instructions on creating the file from the vendor supporting that software program.</p>

            <p class="p_4">The ClientBase import utility can only import tab or comma delimited ASCII text files. This means that the file you are importing must be saved in .txt format and use a carriage return between each profile record, and either a tab or comma between each field within each record. If the file you would like to import is not in this format, use a program like Excel to open the file and then save in .txt format.</p>
            <p class="p_4">The wizard guides you through importing different classifications of profile data:&#160; name, address, communications, marketing, and traveler.&#160; The basic steps for import are:&#160; </p>

            <h3><a name="Updating_Existing_Profiles_vs._Inserting_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Updating Existing Profiles vs. Inserting Profiles</h3>
            <p>There are two methods of importing data - update or insert. Update means you want to replace data that is currently in your database with new data. An example is John Jones is currently in&#160;ClientBase. He visits your website and updates his address, letting you know he moved. You import profiles from your website every week into&#160;ClientBase. Since the profile already exists in&#160;ClientBase, you want the import routine to find this profile and change the address instead of creating a new profile which would be a duplicate. If the entire import was updates, then the number of profiles would not increase.</p>
            <p>Important Note:&#160;As you map the fields from the import file to the fields in ClientBase, it is important to remember that any fields that are being mapped to in ClientBase will be replaced by the value of the field in the import file, even if it is empty.</p>
            <p>Using the insert method means you are adding profiles to the database and the number of profiles in the system increase after the import is complete. An example of this is if you purchase a mailing list and want to load all the profiles into&#160;ClientBase&#160;so you can monitor responses and follow up on these profiles.</p>
