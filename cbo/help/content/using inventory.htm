            <p class="p_1">This section details using a database of inventory maintained in ClientBase Windows version and integrating items into Res Cards for easy entry with inventory control. </p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Introduction_..29" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In ClientBase Windows version, the database administrator has created inventory items for block space and for you to integrate them into the reservation area of Res Cards. The process is an easy one. Block space inventory records are created for air, cruise, hotel, rail, tour, and miscellaneous reservations. Each inventory item is entered one time, with details of the pricing, itinerary, deposit and payment due dates, as well as invoice/itinerary remarks. For use, create a reservation and pull from the list of created inventory records. All Inventory Details automatically drop into the reservation and create a link to the inventory record; therefore tracking what inventory has been taken and what is left. What a great way to manage block space and what a time saver! No more manually tracking inventory using paper controls or supplemental spreadsheet or database programs. </p>
            <p><span>Special Note:</span> Inventory can be allocated across Sync Primary and Sync Copy Databases, see section below,<span class="span_2"> Allocating Inventory Across Sync Primary and Sync Copy Databases.</span></p>

            <p>Once a database of inventory records has been setup, agents in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> can connect to this database of inventory while working in the Res Card (by default it has been enabled for use in the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> setup area. To query inventory for a particular client's trip, create a Res Card for that client including travelers, and from the <span class="span_2">Reservations Link,</span> click <span class="span_2">Add Reservation </span>to select the Travel Type. Please note that Traveler details must be captured within your Res Card in order to pull from inventory, as the number of travelers and ages affect the way the default pricing is calculated. Cruise, Tour and Hotel type inventory pulls one quantity from the available inventory, while Air, Rail and Miscellaneous type inventory pulls 1 quantity per person from the available inventory.</p>
            <p>(If you are pulling more than one inventory item, check off only the travelers that are to be included in the first pull. For example, maybe you have selected 4 travelers, but only the first two are going to be in the cabin you pull. Check off these travelers for the cabin you are pulling. When you pull the second cabin (second reservation), check off the travelers who will be in that cabin.)</p>
            <p>From within a new reservation, click the <span class="span_2">Inventory </span>icon. </p>

            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Searching_for_Inventory" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Searching for Inventory</h2>
            <p>Upon launching inventory from a reservation record, inventory search filters appear by default. Use any inventory search criteria, as well as itinerary/flight/address info and inventory detail information. Each filter entered into the query fields is "anded" together with other filters, so any results match all filters. The more filters entered, the narrower the search and generally fewer results. The fewer filters entered, the more general the search and generally more results. </p>

            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Pulling_From_Inventory" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Pulling From Inventory</h2>
            <p>Upon querying a database of inventory, a one-line listing of each <span class="span_2">Inventory Detail</span> that matches the criteria appears, with a visual display of the inventory detail currently highlighted at the bottom of the screen. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 10 using inventory/using inventory_2.jpg" style="height: 336px;width: 602px;" class="img_1" />

            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Use the radio button or <span class="span_2">View</span>, to call up the desired inventory detail and view the data including what's been blocked, sold and available. </p>
            <p>After locating the desired inventory item to take one of the available seats/cabins/rooms, click <span class="span_2">Pull from Inventory </span>icon at the top of the query screen, and the system returns to the reservation record with all the inventory fields automatically filling in the reservation fields. This simultaneously links the reservation to the inventory detail, therefore allowing the agency to track what's been taken or <span class="span_2">Sold</span>, and therefore what's now <span class="span_2">Available</span>. Any reservation that is linked to inventory displays a link <span class="span_2">xx Quantity Pulled from Inventory"</span> in the upper right hand corner of the reservation record.</p>
            <p>The link to that inventory detail remains permanent, unless the reservation is deleted, or the reservation status is changed to <span class="span_2">Cancelled</span> or <span class="span_2">Quoted</span>, at which time you are prompted for confirmation and if accepted, the link removed and the inventory replaced back into <span class="span_2">Available</span> inventory.</p>
            <p>Each reservation record that has been made as a result of being pulled from Inventory has a link that indicates how the reservation was made (<span class="span_2">xx Qty Pulled from Inventory)</span>:</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Allocating_Inventory_Across_Sync_Primary_and_Sync_Copy_Databases" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Allocating Inventory Across Sync Primary and Sync Copy Databases</h2>
            <p>In the past, agencies that have been synchronizing with another location were limited to creating and pulling from inventory in only the Primary location. The reason for this limitation was because of the potential to oversell inventory between synchronization processes. To overcome this danger, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> has the ability to allocate available inventory across your various sync databases. Sync activated databases have an additional entry tab in <span class="span_2">Inventory Details</span>, called <span class="span_2">Sync Database Allocation.</span>:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 10 using inventory/using inventory_3.jpg" style="height: 383px;width: 547px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Upon creating new Inventory (or updating existing Inventory) look at the count within the <span class="span_2">Available Inventory</span> field. Determine if this inventory should be re-allocated to other sync locations (databases) to facilitate better sales of this inventory. Click the <span class="span_2">Sync Database Allocation</span> tab and <span class="span_2">Re-allocate </span>to re-allocate any quantity available from your current database to any other Sync Copy database.</p>
            <p>The system allocates the inventory to the database the user is connected to. When an agent <span class="span_2">Pulls From Inventory,</span> they are only able to pull inventory allocated to the database they are connected to. As agents use the inventory feature within the Res Card, if they determine that they have a client interested in inventory that is no longer available, they click the <span class="span_2">View Inventory Record</span> and the <span class="span_2">Sync Database Allocation</span> tab to see if there is available inventory in other locations (databases). If so they may suggest re-allocated some of that available inventory to locations (databases) that no longer have any available to them. To re-allocate inventory from one location (database) to another, you must connect to the database that has the available inventory. You can only re-allocate inventory from the database you are connecting to and you can only re-allocate inventory of the database has available inventory records to re-allocate.</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">Important Note for CBB/CBO Agencies Syncing to CBW:</span> If you are synchronizing to the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span><span class="span_2">Windows</span> application, <span>DO NOT</span> allocate inventory to that database unless you are OK with not being able re-allocate it back out of CBB or CBO! <span class="span_2">ClientBase Online </span>does not yet include the Inventory Manager and therefore do not have the ability to re-allocate its unused available inventory back to other databases. This means any inventory allocated to CBB or CBO, will have to be sold via CBB or CBO, or the agency would have to connect to the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Windows application in order to re-allocate it back to CBB/CBO.</p>
            <p>When pulling from Inventory, the system defaults using one of two <span class="span_2">Default Inventory Filters</span>:</p>
            <p>1) <span>Reservation Travel Category</span> - this prompts the Query window with the Travel Category field defaulted to the same category selected in the Reservation. </p>
            <p>2) <span>Res Card Group Name</span> - this now skips the Query window and directly prompts results of ALL inventories (if any) that matches Group Name in the Res Card. You must click <span class="span_2">Query</span> button to change drop-down field default back to <span class="span_2">Reservation Travel Category.</span></p>
