            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Introduction_..35" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Agent productivity is a requirement for agency success. To be productive, an agent must manage relationships with agency customers, record key contacts with customers, follow up on leads, and administer agent tasks and To-Do lists. Wow, that sounds like a lot for an agent to do! </p>
            <p>Fortunately, the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Activity Manager provides the tools to achieve these goals in the form of <span>Notes</span>, <span>Reminders</span> and <span>Mailers.</span> Agents learn how to use these powerful tools to develop habits which ensure their own increased productivity. An agent who is well-organized and productive is likely to have a following of happy customers. Your agency’s marketing and management team benefit as well.</p>

            <p>After users begin using Notes, Reminders and Mailers (as detailed in chapter, <span>An In-Depth Look at Activities</span>) to document vital customer contacts, they will want to start each work day by signing into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and clicking on the <span class="span_2">Activities</span> Manager in the ClientBase header. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using activity manager to manage activities/using the activity manager.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Find</span> and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> searches the database for the User Login’s open reminders and the search results screen immediately displays a list of the Reminders (or tasks) the agent needs to complete each day. </p>
            <p>The agent can also click on any of the saved Global or Personal Searches as well. </p>

            </p>
            <p>To retrieve a specific activity, click<span class="span_2"> View</span> next to the entry or the action menu icon (gear). </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>This gear is displayed to the right of <span class="span_2">View</span> and is listed for each record in the query. It has been designed to allow you to perform a variety of actions for that one record without having to open the record first - saving you a few extra clicks of the mouse. Click the gear and the following options appear: </p>
            <p><span>Edit:</span> Takes you directly to the edit activity screen without having to open the activity first and then clicking <span class="span_2">Edit</span>. </p>
            <p><span>Go To Profile:</span> Takes you directly to the profile the selected Activity is attached to. </p>
            <p>On top of the results screen, notice the search areas. A user can use simple or advanced search filters to find activities. These searches can be quite valuable as productivity and management tools. </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Simple_Activity_Search" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Simple Activity Search</h3>
            <p>A simple activity search contains four fields which are strung together with an “and”. In the example below, the query is setup for Sharon <span class="span_2">and</span> All Notes with From Date 01/01/2012 <span class="span_2">and </span>To Date 01/31/12. After setting up the selection criteria, and clicking <span class="span_2">Find</span>, the results appear in the search results screen. </p>

            </p>
            <p>The following are simple search filters:</p>
            <p><span>Login Name: </span>Defaults to the sign-in user. Choose a different user by clicking on the drop-down menu. This is particularly useful if someone is absent, and you want to help them with To-Do items.</p>
            <p><span>Select:</span> Choose from the drop-down menu. Choices are: <span class="span_2">Notes and Open Reminders, Notes and Closed Reminders, All Notes and All Reminders, All Notes, Open Reminders Only, Open Reminders with Alarms, All Reminders, Mailers w/o Responses, Mailers w/Responses, All Mailers, and All Notes, Reminders, </span>and<span class="span_2"> Mailers.</span></p>
            <p><span>From Date/To Date: </span>To select a specific date range for the query, enter the from date here. Use a date format listed below, or double-click on the date from the calendar on the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p class="p_2">Date Fields Formats</p>
            <p>Complete a date field using any one of the following formats or click on date from drop-down: </p>
            <p>1) mmddyy or mmddyyyy (separators are not required); i.e.<span class="span_3">, 021410 </span></p>
            <p>2) ddmmmyy or ddmmmyyyy </p>
            <p>3) 0 (for current month, day and year date) </p>
            <p>4) mm (defaults to current day and year) </p>
            <p>5) mmdd (defaults to current year) </p>
            <p>6) mm-dd-yy, mm/dd/yy, mm.dd.yy (-, / and . are valid separators) </p>
            <p>7) m-d-yy, m/d/yy, m.d.yy</p>

                <br />searching trams back office reminders</h4>
            <p>ClientBase activity searches now display Trams Back Office-created reminders even if they are not linked to a profile (Trams Back Office users have the ability to create reminders that are not linked to a specific profile type). <span>IMPORTANT NOTE:&#160; </span>Because ClientBase Simple Searches only include Active Profiles, Trams Back Office activities that are not linked to any profile will not be shown in results. Users must use the Advanced Search with Profile Status = Blank.&#160; Trams Back Office-created Activities are presented on Activity Reports, even if not linked to a Profile. <br /></p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Advanced_Activity_Searches" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Advanced Activity Searches</h3>
            <p>The <span class="span_2">Go to Advanced Search </span>area of the Activity Manager gives you the ability to search your database of Notes, Reminders and Mailers by virtually any field captured in these records, and includes the ability to search by a particular client as well. This allows you to track the type of marketing tasks scheduled, when and if they have been completed, which agents are completing them, the mailings that are being sent and the response to those mailings. The options are endless. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Go to Advanced Search</span>, and enter selection criteria into the following screen. </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Since this area “remembers” the last search run, click <span class="span_2">Reset</span> to clear. Like the simple search area, the fields are strung together with “ands” across the fields, but within the field you can use “or” to narrow down your search even further. After setting up the search, click <span class="span_2">OK </span>to activate the specialized list.</p>
            <p>The advanced search area contains the following filters to select Activities under the <span class="span_2">Activities link.</span></p>

            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Saving_Searches_for_Easy_Access_..39" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Saving Searches for Easy Access</h3>
            <p>As you can see, queries run in the Activity Manager can become quite complex. With all the available search filters, you can view your activities inside out, upside down or in just about any subset you desire. With this in mind, if there are certain searches that you want to run often, we suggest you save the searches after setting them up. This is called saving a search to a folder. One click on a saved search folder, and the search filters are completed automatically. What a time saver!</p>
            <p>Here are steps for saving a search in the Activity Manager:</p>
            <p>1) Using a simple or advanced search in the Activity Manager, enter search filters and run. </p>
            <p>2) Customize and sort the columns used in the search, by following the directions above. </p>
            <p>3) When satisfied with the results and the look of the results screen, click <span class="span_2">Saved Searches.</span> </p>
            <p>This screen appears: </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using activity manager to manage activities/using the activity manager_6_584x83.jpg" style="width: 584;height: 83;" />
            </p>
            <p>4) From the drop-down menu, choose whether you want the search to be Personal (for your own use only), or Global (for the use of everyone in the agency).</p>
            <p>5) Name the search.</p>
            <p>6) Click OK. The new search folder is located in the list for <span class="span_2">Global Saved Searches</span> or <span class="span_2">Personal Saved Searches</span> in the <span class="span_2">Saved Searches </span>screen, or from the drop-downs at top of the program screen. </p>
            <p>To replace an existing saved folder with a new one, first perform the new search, adjusting the columns/sorts to your specifications, and then click <span class="span_2">Replace</span>. This area also contains the ability to open a search (<span class="span_2">View)</span>, Replace or Rename a search, or Delete a search folder. </p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> saves the filters and results layout, not the search results. The next time you use the saved search, any new data that has been added since it was created, is included in the new search. </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Using_Date_Formulas_in_Saved_Searches" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Using Date Formulas in Saved Searches</h3>
            <p>Since searches can be saved and retrieved for frequent use, the date fields in all searches allow for date formulas. This means any field that has a date, can also contain a formula for that date. The date formula function allows you to create a search and then save it without identifying a specific month, day and year in the <span class="span_2">From</span> and <span class="span_2">To</span> date fields. Instead, the search is processed with a formula for the month, day, day of the week, and year based upon the date the report is processed. </p>
            <p><span>Remember: </span>Make sure the system date and time are correct. </p>
            <p><span>Benefit</span>: When entering a date formula, your system converts it to the intended time period allowing you to run searches and/or save them for future use without the need to modify dates. </p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> The following tables contain sample formulas for specifying dates. Mix and match the absolute and relative parameters in the function. All date formulas start with an = sign. The first number specifies the day of the month, the second number specifies the month, and the third number specifies the year. So if you only have the first number filled in, this means you want this report to reoccur on this day every month, in every year. </p>

            <p>As mentioned previously, at the beginning of each day, users click on the Activity Manager to access their To-Do lists. By clicking on the desired saved search or using the simple search, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> searches the database for the login user’s open reminders and the results screen immediately displays an organized list of the Reminders (or tasks) that the user needs to complete that day:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using activity manager to manage activities/using the activity manager_7_543x203.jpg" style="width: 543;height: 203;" />
            </p>
            <p>A user views the Reminder and its details by clicking <b>View</b> next to the desired entry. Once inside the Reminder, click <b>Edit</b> in the entry to modify or enhance a Reminder (perhaps change the To-Do date). Click <b>Edit</b>, then <b>Delete</b> to remove a Reminder.  The contact informatin is located in the reminder header.  Add a remark and change date of reminder if you cannot contact the client.</p>
            <p> When completing a reminder, add a remark so you can remember at a later date what transpired.  Check the <b>Completed</b> box located within the Reminder record to indicate when a Reminder has been completed. This brings up a date field to enter a date. The completed record "lives" within the profile’s or res card’s activity link for future reference.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>When creating or Editing Reminders a checkbox, <span class="span_2">Update E-mail Calendar after Saving Changes</span>” is visible. When checked, updates are sent to user’s e-mail address. This box is checked by default when the setting from User Settings in <span>Tools|My Login</span> is <span class="span_2">All Reminders</span> or <span class="span_2">Only for Reminders when time is set. </span></p>
            <p>Once you've developed the habit of following up on travel inquires, begin using Reminders to organize other marketing and administrative tasks, such as payment deadlines, checking for documents, and welcome home calls. Reminders are also used to jog your memory of personal obligations such as dentist appointments, picking up dry cleaning, etc. Since all Reminders need to be attached to some type of profile, use your Agent profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to create these type of personal Reminders.</p>
            <p>Retrieve the profiles of your most loyal customers and schedule at least 4 or 5 occasions each year to reach out and touch them. Remind them often of how valuable they are. Use things like birthdays, anniversaries, annual vacation times and holidays as a reason to communicate with your customers. Every time you put your agency in front of your customers, you re-enforce your relationship, reminding them <span class="span_4">you</span> are their travel professional.</p>
            <p class="p_8">Adding New Activities</p>
            <p>Please refer to the chapter entitled <span class="span_2">An In-Depth Look at Activities</span> to learn how to create Notes, Reminders, and Mailers in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Remember anywhere in the program these functions are located on the menu bar. Just click on icon and associate the activity with the appropriate profile to create.</p>
