            <p class="p_1">This chapter demonstrates how to use the Profiles feature in ClientBase.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Introduction_..41" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Located on the main screen of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> are <span class="span_2">Profile</span>, <span class="span_2">Activities</span>, and <span class="span_2">Res Cards</span> links. Clicking on Profiles allows you to search and manage your database of profiles. Stored links and searches for Profiles appear, as well as your search results displayed by profile.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Profiles</span> provide a user with quick access to vital information about clients, vendors, agents and other profiles. From this area, not only can you go into the profile to access every detail of the record, you can also <span class="span_2">locate, add, </span>or <span class="span_2">modify </span>profile records; as well as <span class="span_2">Merge to Doc, Merge to File, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Print</span>. </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Search_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor125"></a>Search Profiles</h2>
            <p>When <span class="span_2">Profiles</span> is first opened, either select a link which contains a stored set of search fields (<span class="span_2">Global </span>or<span class="span_2"> Personal Saved Searches</span>) from the drop-down menus<span class="span_2">, </span>or use the simple search or advanced search area to enter a custom search. (Clicking <span class="span_2">Find </span>produces a list of all profiles.)</p>
            <p>The <span class="span_2">Global Saved Searches</span> or <span class="span_2">Personal Saved Searches </span>are accessible to anyone for general viewing. </p>

            </p>
            <p>They include Leisure Clients, Corporate Clients, Vendors, Agents, Other, All Profiles, Service Providers, and any links with a customized set of query filters that were setup and saved. By clicking on any of these links, you see the completed filters used for this stored search, and a listing on the results screen of all profiles meeting the criteria of the selected searches. You can also locate profiles by using the simple search area or the advanced search area. </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Date_Fields" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor126"></a>Date Fields</h3>
            <p>Complete a date field using any one of the following formats or choose a date from drop-down calendar: </p>
            <p>1) mmddyy or mmddyyyy (separators are not required) </p>
            <p>2) ddmmmyy or ddmmmyyyy </p>
            <p>3) 0 (for current month, day and year date) </p>
            <p>4) mm (defaults to current day and year) </p>
            <p>5) mmdd (defaults to current year) </p>
            <p>6) mm-dd-yy, mm/dd/yy, mm.dd.yy (-, / and . are valid separators) </p>
            <p>7) m-d-yy, m/d/yy, m.d.yy</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Simple_Search_Filters" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor127"></a>Simple Search Filters</h3>
            <p>The simple search area allows you to quickly locate a profile or a group of profiles by completing one or two filters. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 4 using profile manager to manage profiles/using the profile manager.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>The drop-down menu fields identify what you want to <span class="span_2">search by</span> and are completed by selecting from the following: <span class="span_2">Profile Type, Profile Name, Company, Last Name, Traveler/Contact Name, Phone, FAX, Email, Web, Family/Traveler Phone, Interface ID, City, State, and Zip Code.</span></p>
            <p>The blank fields allow you to type in what you want to <span class="span_2">search for</span> and are completed by choosing from the drop-down, or typing in free-flow information. To prevent spelling errors, it is suggested that you type no more than 3 or 4 characters in the free-flowing fields. </p>
            <p>If both fields are used in this search, then the results match both criteria, not either/or. This means the search filters are strung together with an “and” not an “or”. After completing or changing data in the filters, click <span class="span_2">Find. </span>The system automatically sifts through the database and displays the matching profiles in the results screen.</p>
            <p>For example, you are looking for a leisure client, John Smith. Set the first field to <span class="span_2">Profile Type</span> and pick <span class="span_2">Leisure</span> from the drop-down menu in the field to the right. (Additional Profile Types are <span class="span_2">Corporate</span>, <span class="span_2">Service Provider,</span> <span class="span_2">Agent</span>, <span class="span_2">Vendor</span> and <span class="span_2">Other</span>.) Then set the second field to <span class="span_2">Profile Name</span>, type in “smith” and click <span class="span_2">Find</span>. John’s profile appears in the results screen, and can be entered by clicking <span class="span_2">View. </span>If any other profiles start with "smith", these would appear in the results screen as well. </p>
            <p><span>Or much easier,</span> when querying a name, enter the first few letters and the system automatically displays all names that are possible matches. For example, searching for the client John Smith, type Smith in the Last Name field and the system will automatically display any profile with the last name of Smith. If you type Smith/J, it will further filter the names showing only those with Smith as the last name and the first names that start with a "J". This works for all Profile Types and all Profile name fields.</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Advanced_Search" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor128"></a>Advanced Search</h3>
            <p>The Advanced Search provides additional filters that allow you to more narrowly define your search. Search filters are selected by clicking <span class="span_2">Go To Advanced Search, </span>then <span class="span_2">Enter Data to Search by, </span>and completing as many of the search criteria fields as desired:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 4 using profile manager to manage profiles/using the profile manager_1_575x307.jpg" style="width: 575;height: 307;" />
            </p>
            <p>Since this area “remembers” the last search, click <span class="span_2">Reset</span> to clear an old search. Always do this first when doing an advanced search, as there may be data remaining in other search links that you can’t see. </p>
            <p>Presently the <span class="span_2">General Info, Marketing Codes, Activities, Traveler/Contact, Res Card, More Field </span>and <span class="span_2">Travel History </span>profile links are available at this time for selection criteria entry. Search across all fields of information. Like the simple search area, the selection criteria entered within a link or across links are strung together with “ands”, so the resulting profiles must match all criteria. By clicking <span class="span_2">OK</span>, the query is completed and a list of profiles matching the search appears on the Results Screen. </p>
            <p>**When a user searches for an email address, phone number, etc., the search looks for a match at both the Profile and Traveler communication entries and returns the result. If the Primary box is checked when querying, the Profile's Primary communication entries and the Primary Traveler's Primary communication entries are both searched. When searching for communication entries from the Traveler tab, only Traveler level communication entries are searched.</p>
            <p>A Simple Search by address includes both Profile and Traveler addresses. For Advanced Search, searching on Address fields from the General Info section includes both Profile and Traveler addresses, IF none of the Address Type boxes are checked. Once any Type box is checked, only Profile addresses of that type are included. In order to search only for Traveler addresses, users must click the Traveler/Contact link.</p>
            <p>**Because Travelers can now be linked to multiple Profiles, searching by a communication entry will return all Profiles that a Traveler is linked to in the search results, if that Traveler meets the search criteria. Also, because a Profile and a Traveler can both have a primary communication, multiple primary communication entries may be displayed for the same profile. </p>
            <p>There is a Primary checkbox on the Traveler/Contact Communication section of Advanced Search. When checked, only a Traveler's Primary communication entries will be returned in the search results. </p>
            <p><span>Example of an Advanced Search:</span> You want to see how many new client profiles were created this month. By using the Advanced Search area, fill in the Profile Create Date fields with the month parameters and click <span class="span_2">OK </span>to run the query. </p>
            <p>When using Marketing Codes as selection criteria in the advanced search area, you use multiple marketing tables and even multiple marketing codes within your search criteria. Any codes entered are “anded” together across the tables, but “or’d” together within a table. For example, if you place a check in the <span class="span_2">Cruise </span>code within the<span class="span_2"> What Type</span> table, and a check in the<span class="span_2"> Deluxe </span>code within the <span class="span_2">What Budget</span> table, you only get clients that are coded for <span>both</span> codes, or, in other words, Deluxe Cruisers. If you place a check in the <span class="span_2">Cruise </span>code and a check in the <span class="span_2">Tour</span> code within the same <span class="span_2">What Type</span> table, you get clients that are coded with <span>either</span> Cruise or Tour. The results include any clients that are either interested in Cruises or Tours and are deluxe budgeted.</p>
            <p>You see a summary of the search in the gray area directly above the Results Screen by scrolling down. </p>

            <p>This icon is displayed to the right of <span class="span_2">View</span> and is listed for each record in the query. It has been designed to allow you to perform a variety of actions for that one record without having to open the record first - saving you a few extra clicks of the mouse. </p>
            <p>Click the icon and the following options appear: </p>
            <p>

Yes or No.</span> If <span class="span_2">Yes</span> is selected, then the system checks to see if any Invoices, Payments, Res Cards, Activities or Inventory exist for the profile. If not, then the profile is deleted. If Invoices, Payments, Res Cards, Activities or Inventory exist for the profile, the system prompts that these records must be deleted before the profile can be deleted. Note: Profiles can be set to Inactive as an alternative to deleting.</p>
            <p><span>Anonymize:</span> Used when a client requests that an agency delete their personal data, but their profile cannot be deleted due to the presence of res cards, invoices/booking, and/or payments.</p>
            <p class="p_2"><b>Note:</b>&#160;Only users with with Manager authorization and Read/Write profile rights can anonymize a profile.</p>
            <p>The Anonymize Profile feature removes or overwrites Remarks, Record Locators, IUR records, Traveler Names, Check/Credit Card numbers, Attachments, free flow Traveler Names, and Activities from Invoices and/or Bookings belonging to a profile that is being anonymized.</p>
            <p>Profiles with open invoices and/or payments cannot be anonymized. Groups will not be cleared as they may be required for reporting purposes.</p>
            <p>The profile is set to inactive status after anonymizing.</p>
            <p><span>Export Profile:</span> Exports all field data in a machine-readable JSON format, so that agencies can provide their customers with personal data portability.

            <p>- Because Travelers can now be linked to multiple Profiles, searching by a communication entry will return all Profiles that a Traveler is linked to in the search results, if that Traveler meets the search criteria. Also, because a Profile and a Traveler can both have a primary communication, multiple primary communication entries may be displayed for the same profile. </p>

            <p>As you can see, searches run in the Profile Manager can become quite complex. With the available searches, you can view the database inside out, upside down or in just about any subset you desire. With this in mind, if there are certain searches that you want to run often, we suggest you save them after setting up. This is called saving a search to a folder. One click on a saved search folder, and the search filters are completed automatically. What a time saver!</p>
            <p>Here are steps for saving a search in the Profile Manager:</p>
            <p>1) Using an easy or advanced search, enter search filters and run your search. </p>
            <p>2) Customize and sort the columns used in the search, by following the directions above. </p>
            <p>3) When satisfied with the search results and the look of the results screen, click <span class="span_2">Saved Searches.</span> </p>
            <p>This screen appears: </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>4) From the drop-down Level menu, choose whether you want the search to be Personal (for your own use only), or Global (for the use of everyone in the agency).</p>
            <p>5) Name the search.</p>
            <p>6) Click OK. The new search folder is located in the list for <span class="span_2">Global Saved Searches</span> or <span class="span_2">Personal Saved Searches</span> in the <span class="span_2">Saved Searches</span> screen, or from the drop-downs at top of the program screen. </p>
            <p>To replace an existing saved search folder with a new one, first perform the new search, adjusting the columns/sorts to your specifications, and then click <span class="span_2">Replace</span>. This area also contains the ability to Open a Search (<span class="span_2">View)</span>, Rename a Search (<span class="span_2">Rename)</span>, or Delete a Search (<span class="span_2">Delete)</span>. </p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> saves the filters and results layout, not the search results. The next time you use the saved search, any new data that has been added since it was created, is included in the new search.</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Using_Date_Formulas_in_Your_Saved_Searches_..45" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor133"></a>Using Date Formulas in Your Saved Searches</h3>
            <p>Since searches can be saved and retrieved for frequent use, the date fields in all searches allow for date formulas. This means any field that has a date, can also contain a formula for that date. The date formula function allows you to create a search and then save it without identifying a specific month, day and year in the <span class="span_2">From</span> and <span class="span_2">To</span> date fields. Instead, the search is processed with a formula for the month, day, day of the week, and year based upon the date the report is processed. <br /><span>Remember: </span>Make sure the system date and time are correct. </p>
            <p><span>Benefit</span>: When entering a date formula, your system converts it to the intended time period allowing you to run searches and/or save them for future use without the need to modify dates. </p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> The following tables contain sample formulas for specifying dates. Mix and match the absolute and relative parameters in the function. All date formulas start with an = sign. The first number specifies the day of the month, the second number specifies the month, and the third number specifies the year. So if you only have the first number filled in, this means you want this report to reoccur on this day every month, in every year. </p>

            <p>When a customer contacts the agency, the first thing an agent does is check the Profile Manager (by clicking the <span class="span_2">Profiles </span>tab) to determine if that customer is in the database. Do this by searching in the Profile Manager as detailed above. Avoid creating duplicate profiles! If a client is not in the agency’s <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database, the agent creates a new customer profile. This can be done by clicking <span class="span_2">Create Profile </span>on the menu bar, and selecting the appropriate profile type - <span class="span_2">Leisure, Corporate, Service Provider, Vendor, Agent, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Other.</span> </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>When you have entered a brand-new profile screen, fill out the profile details, and click <span class="span_2">Save </span>or <span class="span_2">Cancel </span>which aborts the process.</p>
            <p>Entering information for anyone who contacts the agency is essential, particularly the address and communication methods such as phone, cell phone, Email, etc. At the very least, the agent should complete the address and communication information, and if your agency has <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>, it is very important to complete the Interface ID field as well.</p>
            <p><span>Helpful tip:</span> Want a quick way to create a profile? Use the following <span class="span_2">hot keys:</span></p>

            <p><span>Fields to Convert:</span> Place a check into each field you would like the system to convert, including <span class="span_2">Profile, Address and Passenger</span> fields.</p>
            <p><span>Include Records:</span> Allows you to determine what profiles should be converted. Select either <span class="span_2">All Results in Current Manager or Select Results in Current Manager</span>. (You must search for the profiles you would like case converted before running this.)</p>
            <p><span>Global Convert Now:</span> Run the case conversion. Records Modified will display the number of records affected by the conversion.</p>
            <p><span>Special Note:</span> There is a Auto-Case Converter setting in <span>Tools|Settings</span>. Within this area a listing of the following profile fields is available for automatic case handling: Name, First Name, Last Name, Courtesy Title, Address 1, Address 2, Apt/Suite, City, Country, Passenger First Name, Passenger Last Name, Passenger Courtesy Title, and Passenger Relationship/Title. </p>

            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>By placing a check into any of these fields, as you are working within your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profiles, the first letter of each word entered will be automatically capitalized and the remaining letters will be automatically set to lower case.

            <p>By clicking the Global Modify under Tools, you have the ability change multiple profiles simultaneously without having to enter each profile to make the desired change, i.e., adding a Marketing Code. </p>
            <p><span>Step 1:</span> Use the Profile Manager Simple or Advanced Search to query the desired profiles you would like to modify.</p>
            <p><span>Step 2:</span> To modify all query results select Global Modify under the Tools menu. To modify just select results, first click on the profiles you would like to modify to highlight in blue (to deselect click the profile again to remove the blue highlighting), then select Global Modify under the Tools menu.</p>

            <p><span>Step 4:</span> Select the field you would like to modify from the drop down listing, and then enter the new value you would like all profiles to be updated with.</p>
            <p><span>Step 5:</span> Identify whether you want <span class="span_2">All Results</span> or just <span class="span_2">Selected Results</span> in the Profile Manager to be modified. (By holding down the control key and clicking entries on the results screen, you can select just some of the entries to be modified.) </p>
            <p><span>Step 6:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Global Modify Now</span> once you are sure you have the proper profiles identified and once you are sure you have the proper changes selected. You will be prompted that there is no un-do feature before continuing.</p>
            <p><span>Important Note:</span> Global Modify is a powerful feature that makes mass updating a simple process. Improper use of Global Modify could cause permanent loss of valuable profile data that cannot be undone. Only Users with the Authorization setting of "Manager" will have access to Global Modify. Be sure to only authorize this for users that should have this type of functionality and have been properly trained on it.</p>
