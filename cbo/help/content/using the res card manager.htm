            <p class="p_1">This section details the use of the Res Card Manager to easily organize and manage your reservation and trip data stored neatly in your Res Cards. </p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Introduction_..27" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the Res Card Manager is to automate the filing cabinet which has historically contained hundreds of paper index cards and file folders that have for years cluttered agencies. In the past, agents often entered details of leisure type reservations (client information, confirmation numbers, itineraries, vendor information, remarks, etc.) on cards. Agents kept these cards somewhere on their desks or somewhere in their files. That “somewhere” translated into precious time spent searching for the reservation information, especially when the booking agent was not available and someone else needed to locate the information. As agents begin automating their non-CRS reservation information into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Cards, the Res Card Manager provides you with a tool to organize and manage your entire database of Res Card records. Imagine viewing all of your active Res Cards with the click of a button.</p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Search_for_Res_Cards" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor20"></a>Search for Res Cards</h2>
            <p>After users begin using Res Cards (as detailed in chapter, <span>An In-Depth Look at Res Cards</span>) to document reservation details, they’ll click on the <span class="span_2">Res Cards </span>tab to see their active Res Cards. Click <span class="span_2">Find</span> and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> searches the database for the User Login’s active Res Cards and the Results Screen immediately displays a list.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>To retrieve a specific Res Card, click<span class="span_2"> View</span> next to the entry or the action menu icon (gear). </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using res card manager to manage res cards/using the res card manager_462x179.jpg" style="width: 462;height: 179;" />
            </p>
            <p>This icon is displayed to the right of <span class="span_2">View</span> and is listed for each record in the search. It has been designed to allow you to perform a variety of actions for that one record without having to open the record first - saving you a few extra clicks of the mouse. Click the icon and the following options appear: </p>
            <p><span>View:</span> Takes you directly to the edit Res Card screen without having to open the Res Card first and then clicking <span class="span_2">Edit</span>. </p>
            <p><span>Generate Invoice: </span>Takes you directly to the invoice screen for you to produce an invoice for the Res Card.</p>
            <p><span>Go To Profile:</span> Takes you directly to the profile the selected Res Card is attached to. </p>
            <p><span>Delete:</span> Delete a Res Card, but if the Res Card has invoices or Activities attached, those must be deleted first.</p>
            <p>An agent can also click on any of the saved search links either at the Global or Personal Level as well. At the top of the results screen, notice 2 links marked <span class="span_2">Global Saved Searches </span>and<span class="span_2"> Personal Saved Searches</span>. </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Simple_Res_Card_Search" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Simple Res Card Search</h3>
            <p>A simple Res Card search allows you to quickly locate a Res Card or a group of Res Cards by simply completing one or two search filters. This search contains four fields which are strung together with an “and”.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using res card manager to manage res cards/using the res card manager_1.jpg" />
            </p>
            <p>The drop-down menu fields identify what you want to search <span class="span_2">by</span> and are completed by selecting from the following: <span class="span_2">Agent Name, Trip Name, Status, Reservation Cycle, Source of Booking, Locator No., Group Name, Region.</span> The defaults for these two fields are <span class="span_2">Agent Name</span> and <span class="span_2">Status. </span></p>
            <p>The blank field allows you to make you selection from a default pull-down list or type in free-flow information if there is no pull-down list. An arrow to the right of the blank field indicates a list from a pull-down menu exists for ease of selection for that search filter. If both fields are used in the search, then the results will match both criteria, not either/or. This means the filters are strung together with an “and” not an “or.” After completing or changing data in the filters, the system automatically sifts through the database and displays the matching profiles in the results screen.</p>
            <p>For example, if Agent Sharon wants to review all her active Res Cards in the system, she sets the first field to <span class="span_2">Agent Name</span> and selects the name <span class="span_2">Sharon</span> from the pull-down menu list. She sets the second field to <span class="span_2">Status</span> and selects “Active” from the pull-down menu. Finally, she clicks on <span class="span_2">Find </span>to see a list of all her active Res Cards in the system. </p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Advanced_Res_Card_Search" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Advanced Res Card Search</h3>
            <p><span class="span_2">Go to Advanced Search|Enter Data to Search </span>gives you the ability to search your database of Res Cards by virtually any field captured in these records, and includes the ability to search by a particular client as well. The search area is divided into three search layers that move from more general information at the Res Card Level to very specific, detailed search criteria at the Service Provider Level.</p>
            <p>1. Res Card Level</p>
            <p>2. Reservation Level</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using res card manager to manage res cards/using the res card manager_2_505x414.jpg" style="width: 505;height: 414;" />
            </p>
            <p>3. Service Provider Level</p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="Res_Card_Link" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Res Card Link</h4>
            <p>1. <span>Res Card Level:</span> Except for selecting the date range you wish to search by, the trip name and Locator #, all other search fields have a pull-down menu indicated by the arrow to the right of the field for easy selection. The Res Card query level is composed of broader search fields and generally includes a greater number of Res Cards in the results screen.</p>
            <p>2. <span>Reservation Level: </span>The Reservation Query level fields focus on the specific components of the reservation. From Travel Category and Vendor to Reservation Status and Payment Information, you can direct your search of your database at this level. </p>
            <p>3. <span>Service Provider Level: </span>The fields at the Service Provider level, when completed, can be extremely helpful as a quick reference when a customer calls in requesting information on a particular reservation. From travel category and beginning and ending dates of specific reservations such as cars and hotels, to individual client preferences such as cabin or dining preferences, these fields allow you to very narrowly define your query. </p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="PROFILE_Link" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>PROFILE Link</h4>
            <p>Use general profile data as filters when running an advanced search in the Res Card Manager. This gives you the ability to search by profile to locate Res Cards as well as enhances your ability to search your lists of Res Cards. </p>
            <p>To see a summary of the search filters click the <span class="span_2">Filter Summary </span>which is a double up arrow in the <span class="span_2">Results Screen</span>.</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Results_Screen" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Results Screen</h3>
            <p>After you have completed your searches, the Results Screen not only provides a count and list of search results, but also easy access to a specific Res Card. To obtain a count of the query results, click <span class="span_2">Count</span>. To view the next screen of Res Cards on the list, click <span class="span_2">Next </span>directly above the results screen. </p>
            <p>To retrieve any Res Card, simply click <span class="span_2">View</span> before the entry. </p>
            <h4><a name="Navigation_Bar" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Navigation Bar</h4>
            <p class="Heading3Char">

            </p>
            <p>The Navigation Bar provides a means to jump to various Res Cards in the results screen by using <span class="span_2">First, Previous, Next </span>and <span class="span_2">Last. </span>Also on this bar are <span class="span_2">Count, Select Columns </span>and <span class="span_2">Sort by Columns.</span></p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Select_Columns" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Select Columns</h3>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Select Columns </span>to choose which columns you want displayed in your query results screen. </p>
            <p>To change a column, move the highlighted column over to the other side by using the <span>&gt;</span> or <span>&lt; </span>arrow. By using the shift key and mouse, select as many consecutive entries as you want to move; by using the control key and your mouse, select non-consecutive entries to move. Use the <span>&gt;&gt;</span> or <span>&lt;&lt; </span>arrows to move <span class="span_3">all columns</span> at one time over to the other side. Use the up and down<span> arrow</span> buttons to order your selections. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to save, and <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> to abort.</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Sort_by_Columns" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Sort by Columns</h3>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Sort by Columns </span>to sort columns query results screen. </p>
            <p>Sort up to 3 columns in ascending or descending order, and click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to save, or <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> to abort<span class="span_2">.</span></p>
            <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Saving_Searches_for_Easy_Access" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Saving Searches for Easy Access</h2>
            <p>As you can see, searches run in the Res Card Manager can become quite complex. With all the available filters in the simple and advanced searches, view your database inside out, upside down or in just about any subset you desire. With this in mind, if there are certain searches that you want to run often, we suggest you save the search filters after setting them up. This is called saving a search to a folder. One click on a saved search folder, and the filters are completed automatically. What a time saver!</p>
            <p>Here are steps for saving a query in the Res Card Manager:</p>
            <p>1) Enter search filters and run your query. </p>
            <p>2) Customize and sort the columns by following the directions above. </p>
            <p>3) When satisfied with the search results and the look of the results screen, click <span class="span_2">Saved Searches.</span> </p>
            <p>This screen appears: </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 11 using res card manager to manage res cards/using the res card manager_4.jpg" style="height: 142px;width: 548px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>4) From the drop-down menu, choose whether you want the search to be Personal (for your own use only), or Global (for the use of everyone in the agency).</p>
            <p>5) Name the search.</p>
            <p>6) Click OK. The new search folder is located in the list for <span class="span_2">Global Saved Searches</span> or <span class="span_2">Personal Saved Searches</span> in the <span class="span_2">Saved Searches</span> screen, or from the drop-downs at top of the program screen. </p>
            <p>To replace an existing saved folder with a new one, first perform the new search, adjusting the columns/sorts to your specifications, and then click <span class="span_2">Replace</span>. This area also contains the ability to open a search (<span class="span_2">View)</span>, rename a search folder (<span class="span_2">Rename)</span>, or delete a search folder (<span class="span_2">Delete)</span>. </p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> saves the filters and results layout, not the search results. The next time you use the saved search folder, any new data that has been added since it was created, is included in the new search.</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Using_Date_Formulas_in_Your_Saved_Searches" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Using Date Formulas in Your Saved Searches</h3>
            <p>Since searches can be saved and retrieved for frequent use, the date fields in all searches allow for date formulas. This means any field that has a date, can also contain a formula for that date. The date formula function allows you to create a search and then save it without identifying a specific month, day and year in the <span class="span_2">From</span> and <span class="span_2">To</span> date fields. Instead, the search is processed with a formula for the month, day, day of the week, and year based upon the date the report is processed. </p>
            <p><span>Remember: </span>Make sure the system date and time are correct. </p>
            <p><span>Benefit</span>: When entering a date formula, your system converts it to the intended time period allowing you to run searches and/or save them for future use without the need to modify dates. </p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> The following tables contain sample formulas for specifying dates. Mix and match the absolute and relative parameters in the function. All date formulas start with an = sign. The first number specifies the day of the month, the second number specifies the month, and the third number specifies the year. So if you only have the first number filled in, this means you want this report to reoccur on this day every month, in every year. </p>
