            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Fixed an issue where sync does not occur between a matching ClientBase and Sabre Profiles Traveler if the ClientBase Traveler profile contains entries that do not sync to Sabre Profiles (such as Preferred Vendor or PNR Entry).<br /><br /></p>

            <h2>Changes made between 4.08.00.039 and 4.08.00.070</h2>
            <h3>Profile Import Related, ClientBase to Sabre Profiles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Fixed an issue where the ClientBase Emergency Contact was not added to the corresponding Sabre Profile as an additional Emergency Contact, causing the ClientBase Emergency Contact to be lost when the Sabre Profile synced back to ClientBase.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When ClientBase profiles are synced to Sabre Profiles, we strip out all punctuation that Sabre Profiles does not allow in its profile names&#160;-- only slashes and periods are permitted, so we remove any other punctuation.&#160; Affected fields are Profile Name, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, and Title.&#160;We do not strip out&#160;special characters&#160;such as á,&#160;ç,&#160;å,&#160;ñ,&#160;ø, et cetera. If someone updates the Sabre Profile and tries to save it with those characters, they will need to update the name.&#160;Once any&#160;update is made to the Sabre Profile,&#160;the corrected/un-punctuated name will sync back to ClientBase.<br /><br /></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Profile Import Related, Sabre Profiles to ClientBase</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>When a Sabre Traveler has a DK or AN that matches the Interface ID of more than ClientBase Corporate and/or Group profile, that Traveler will be linked to all of those ClientBase profiles.&#160;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fixed an issue where Sabre Profiles with blank or duplicate Order Sequence Numbers returned an error and did not sync.&#160;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sabre Profiles Traveler associations to Sabre Profiles Corporate and Group profiles acquired through a template are now retained after sync to ClientBase.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Because Sabre Profiles does not contain a field for a profile's Primary Agent, we created a workaround using the System ID field in the Business System Identity subject area. Enter the Interface ID of the ClientBase Agent Profile that you wish to assign as the Primary Agent. Upon syncing from Sabre Profiles to ClientBase, we search the Agent Profiles in ClientBase for one that has that Interface ID, and assign that agent as the Primary Agent of the profile. This is only done once, on the initial profile creation or merge. The primary agent won't be updated if the System ID is edited later, nor will the System ID be updated if the profile's primary agent is changed in ClientBase.&#160;<br /></p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                        <li>
                            <p>If there is more than one Agent Profile using that Interface ID, the system will use the first one it comes across, so please make sure your ClientBase agent profiles all have unique Interface IDs if this is important to your agency (For example, for access permissions).&#160;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Special note on Sabre Profiles Travelers: Only if a Leisure wrapper profile is created will the Primary agent be assigned in this way. If not, the Primary Agent of the associated corporate or leisure profiles will serve as that Traveler's Primary Agent.&#160;<br /><br /></p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Profile Update Related</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The Branch Number field in ClientBase is synced with the Sabre Profiles field Branch ID. ClientBase will only accept a number for a Branch, whereas Sabre Profiles will allow any kind of text. We have also made Branch ID a required field in our default templates. Therefore, we had to make some exceptions to our usual sync rules for this field.</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                        <li>
                            <p>If the Sabre Profile has a Branch ID that is blank or contains any value other than a number between 0 and 999, it will not sync to ClientBase.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If the ClientBase Branch Number is blank, upon syncing the profile into Sabre Profiles, the Sabre Profile's Branch ID will be set to UNDEFINED. Note that this is not a valid value for a ClientBase branch, so it will not sync back into ClientBase and the ClientBase profile's branch ID will remain blank.&#160;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If the Sabre Profile or the ClientBase profile is updated with a valid, numeric Branch Number/Branch ID, then those values will sync as usual, with the most recent update replacing the value on the other side.&#160;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">When a ClientBase profile is deleted, upon syncing the change to Sabre Profiles, it is marked for purge and set to delete in 24 hours. If the Sabre Profile is updated after the ClientBase profile is updated, but before the change syncs over to Sabre Profiles, then the Sabre Profile will not be purged, and the updates made will sync the Profile back to ClientBase as a new profile.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">Fixed an issue where SPS profiles with more than one default PNR Builder template could not be updated with changes synced from ClientBase. <br /><br /></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Template Related</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Added Branch ID (under Additional Profile Information &gt; Employment Information &gt; More Options) as a field for the default ClientBase Traveler template. This will populate the ClientBase Branch Number field of any Leisure Wrapper profile created for the Sabre Profiles Traveler. If the Traveler is associated with a Corporate or Group/Leisure profile, then that profile's branch number will serve as the ClientBase Traveler's branch.&#160;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Added the Business System Identity System ID field to the default ClientBase Corporate, Leisure, and Traveler templates.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If you modify our default templates by&#160;adding another field that we do not sync, and making it required, you may encounter an error. After that error is corrected, associations between profiles may not be created properly. If you want to modify the default templates provided, don't make any additional fields required.<br />&#160;</p>
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">Fixed an issue where the INIT report incorrectly showed that a Leisure Wrapper profile would be created for SP Travelers with an association to a Group or Corporate profile.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">The INIT report no longer lists linked profiles in the Merged Traveler section.</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">Added explanatory text in the new traveler section to explain that if there is not any linked profile listed, then it will be linked to a new leisure profile.</p>

            <h3>Profile Import Related, Sabre Profiles to ClientBase</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Added the ability to assign a ClientBase Primary Agent to Corporate and Leisure profiles using the System ID field in the Business System Identity subject area. This field is mapped to the ClientBase profile’s Primary Agent field. &#160;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We now link Sabre Profiles Travelers to to any and all ClientBase Corporate and Leisure profiles where the Sabre Profiles DK or AN number matches the ClientBase Interface ID.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fixed a "VALIDATOR RULE The following required element is missing" message that occurred when the attached template has a field designated as required which does not sync to ClientBase.<br /><br /></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Profile Import Related, ClientBase to Sabre Profiles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">Fixed an issue where a ClientBase mailing address designated as both “Bill To” and “hip To” did not split into two addresses, one Billing and one Delivery, upon syncing into Sabre Profiles.<br /><br /></p>

            <h3>Profile Merge Related</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">Fixed an issue where Emergency Contacts only matched if the Contact had a single word in First Name and a single word in Last Name. Syncing contacts with a Middle Name or a multi-word First/Last Name (Mary Alice, Van der Beek) caused an additional Emergency Contact to be created.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">Fixed an issue where synchronizing duplicate profiles or travelers, each with the same address, merged the profile or traveler correctly, but added duplicate addresses to them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">Fixed an issue where, when profiles merge, sync was creating duplicate profiles instead when the Sabre Profiles DK was not all in upper case like the ClientBase Interface ID. This matching criterion is no longer case sensitive.<br /><br /></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">Fixed an issue where a later Sabre Profiles change was replaced with earlier ClientBase change, thus the Sabre Profile record did not sync, and traveler values were not updated when ClientBase changes synced before the Sabre Profile notification(s) arrived.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="ListParagraph">When a ClientBase profile is deleted, upon syncing the change to Sabre Profiles, it is marked for purge and set to delete in 24 hours.
