            <p class="p_2">This chapter demonstrates how the use of Reminders, Notes and Mailers creates user efficiency, increases productivity and enhances customer relationships.</p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..82" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>One of the most difficult challenges that today's travel agency faces is how to keep current clients loyal and develop long-term relationships with new customers. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> is designed to help agencies achieve these goals by tracking all types of client contacts in a well-organized manner by creating an electronic history. In addition, users can easily setup follow up reminders, note customer comments and questions, and track all correspondence associated with a specific profile. This chapter shows you how easy this is.</p>

            <h3><a name="Notes" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor294"></a>Notes</h3>

            </p>
            <p>Each time a contact is made by the agency with your customer, valuable information is received. These contacts should be documented in the form of a <span class="span_2">Note</span>. A <span class="span_2">Note</span> in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> is contained within a client profile and is similar to a “post-it note,” complete with date of contact, user login and remarks. </p>
            <h4><a name="Creating_a_Note_from_Within_a_Client’s_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Creating a Note from Within a Client’s Profile</h4>
            <p>A Profile or Res Card can have any number of notes attached to it. This allows any agent interacting with the customer to view all past contacts. For example, Clara Adam’s calls the agency saying she will be late with a final deposit. The agent, Sharon, creates a note in the trip’s Res Card (notes in the Res Card can be also viewed in the Client Profile activity tab) documenting this development. Not only will Clara’s note be “filed” in her profile, but it can be used, along with other notes, to run reports and keep anyone who enters the profile or Res Card informed that this deposit will be made late.</p>

Mailers provide tracking capability for every printed communication your agency sends to clients using document templates, labels or e-mail. As with notes and reminders, mailers are created and attached to a Client Profile or Res Card. Any profile or Res Card can have any number of mailers attached to it. </p><p><span>Mailer Entry Screen </span><span>Wi</span><span>thin a Client Profile </span></p><p class="p_8"><img src="resources/images/chapter 10 an in-depth look at activities/mailers_1.jpg" style="height: 342px;width: 430px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/An%20In-depth%20Look%20at%20Activities.14.1.8.jpg" class="img_1" /></p><p><span>Go to Profile Button: </span>Click here to easily toggle between the mailer and the profile. </p><p><span>Print Detail:</span> Click to print out mailer details.</p><p><span>Name &amp; Address Detail:</span> At A Glance view the client’s name and address.</p><p><span>Phone:</span> Phone number of client is displayed for easy referral.</p><p><span>E-mail:</span> E-mail of client is displayed for easy referral.</p><p><span>Date|Time of Mailer: </span>Defaults to today’s date|time.

Be careful though, or you may end up creating activities for the wrong client, as every activity must be attached to a profile, so the system defaults the current profile you are in. If you make an error though, and attach the activity to the wrong profile, you can now use this feature to re-associate the record with the correct one. </p><p>To change the profile an activity is linked to, type a portion of the client’s name (Last/First) and click the drop-down arrow to get a listing of matching profiles to select from.</p><p>&#160;</p></div>
