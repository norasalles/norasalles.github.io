            <p>This section details creating a database of inventory and integrating items into Res Cards for easy entry with inventory control. It also demonstrates the use of the Inventory Manager to easily organize and manage inventory records.</p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..70" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> create inventory items for block space and integrate them into the reservation area of Res Cards. The process is an easy one. Block space inventory records can be created for air, cruise, hotel, rail, tour, and miscellaneous reservations. Enter each inventory item one time, with details of the pricing, itinerary, deposit and payment due dates, as well as invoice/itinerary remarks. Next, create a reservation and pull from the list of created inventory records. All <span class="span_2">Inventory Details</span> automatically drop into the reservation and create a link to the inventory record; therefore tracking what inventory has been taken and what is left. What a great way to manage block space and what a time saver! No more manually tracking inventory using paper controls or supplemental spreadsheet or database programs. </p>
            <h2><a name="Creating_a_Database_of_Inventory" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor37"></a>Creating a Database of Inventory </h2>
            <p>From anywhere in the program, create inventory items by clicking the <span class="span_2">Inventory </span>icon on the toolbar, or going to <span>File|New|Inventory</span>. You can also create inventory by right-mouse clicking in the results screen of the Inventory Manager.</p>
            <p>An inventory record is made up of header information, which includes constant information such as vendor, service provider, itinerary, and dates of travel. In addition to the header information, an inventory record also includes <span class="span_2">Inventory Details</span>. One inventory record can include multiple inventory details. <span class="span_2">Inventory Details</span> include quantity, description and pricing. For example, if you have blocked space for 2 different categories of cabins on an October sailing of Carnival's Ecstasy, enter one inventory record with 2 inventory details, one for each cabin category with the quantity blocked and its pricing.</p>
            <h3><a name="GENERAL_TAB_(Top)" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>GENERAL TAB (Top)</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 16 creating and using inventory/creating and using inventory_624x422.png" style="width: 624;height: 422;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Depending on the travel category selected, different tabs of information appear with different fields of information within those tabs. The current travel categories available for inventory entry are Air, Cruise, Hotel, Rail, Tour and Miscellaneous. The variation in tabs and fields based on the travel category parallel the variations included by travel category within the Res Card reservation records.</p>
            <p><span>Date Reserved:</span> Manually enter or choose date from the drop-down menu. This is the date this block space is reserved.</p>
            <p><span>Inventory ID:</span> This unique ID is user definable and can be used to Query inventory items. For example, an Ensenada Cruise ID might read, CR063008 (using CR for cruise and the date). </p>
            <p><span>Travel Category:</span> From the drop-down menu, select the appropriate travel category from <span class="span_2">Air, Cruise, Hotel, Miscellaneous, Rail </span>or<span class="span_2"> Tour.</span></p>
            <p><span>Vendor:</span> Type in a few letters of the vendor’s name and choose vendor from drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span>Airline/Ship/Property/Rail/Service Provider:</span> Depending on the travel type, fill in the service provider profile that applies. For example, if the vendor is Carnival Cruise Lines, the service provider might be <span class="span_2">Ecstasy </span>or <span class="span_2">Jubilation. </span>If you do not have a service provider profiles created, simply type in the service provider. That way you can still Query for that service provider or obtain service provider reports.</p>
            <p><span>Description:</span> Type in a unique description to identify this inventory item. For example, an Ensenada Cruise description might read Ensenada Cruise 06/30/08 (name of cruise location and date). For Air and Rail, the description field is in the Fight Details/Train Details tab. These description fields are populated when pulling from inventory if the this field is completed within the inventory record and is printed on Invoices and Itineraries.</p>
            <p><span>Duration:</span> Type the number of days of the item.</p>
            <p><span>Start Date:</span> Type the start date of the item or double-click the start date off the calendar accessible from the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span>End Date:</span> Type the end date of the item or double-click end date off the calendar accessible from the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span>Utilization Date:</span> Enter a date which can be queried and store review dates, release space dates, or any dates of your choosing. Dates can be changed throughout the sales process. </p>
            <p><span>Expiration Date:</span> Enter date when this item can no longer be used, or double-click the utilization date off the calendar accessible from the drop-down menu. This is <span>important</span> because by entering an expiration date, agents are prevented from pulling inventory into Res Cards after this date, and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> automatically removes all expired inventory from any Query results when launched from the Res Card Inventory button. You can still Query expired inventory from your Inventory Manager, as the record still remains in the database. (If an inventory record has the <span class="span_2">Expiration Date</span> set to today, the inventory continues to appear in Query results and is not considered expired until the day after the expiration date.)</p>
            <p><span>Region: </span>This area includes a hard-coded set of regions and is populated by selecting from a drop- down listing.</p>
            <p><span>Destination:</span> Enter the region/destination of the trip from a detailed list in the drop-down menu. These entries are user-definable under <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Res Cards</span>: <span>Region of Trip</span>, or by clicking on the blue field label if permitted. The user definable Destinations also include the ability to be linked to one of the hard coded Regions. Upon creating inventory, if the Region field is completed first then upon selecting a Destination the drop-down listing will only include a subset of those Destinations linked to that Region. If <span class="span_2">Allow Freeflow</span> is not checked (forcing the users to select from the drop down listing) then multiple Destinations can selected and inserted into one Res Card. </p>
            <p><span>Confirmation #:</span> Enter a confirmation number.</p>
            <p><span>Group ID:</span> Track details of group cruise contracts.Added the ability to associate Group IDs with a Group Name. If a user adds a Group Name and a Group ID to the same Inventory record, the Group ID and Group Name are now associated. When an Inventory Group is viewed from the Group List, any associated Group IDs are listed under <span class="span_2">Linked Inventory Group IDs</span>. (This field only displays if there are Group IDs linked.)</p>

Air, rail and miscellaneous travel categories prompt for unit pricing, while cruise, hotel and tour travel categories prompt for per person pricing based on double occupancy. Any pricing entered into the inventory detail is then used to create the default pricing when an agent pulls from inventory while working in the Res Card reservation area. </p>
            <p>The more complete pricing information within the inventory detail, the more accurate the default pricing is when your agents are pulling from this inventory record. For example, if no child pricing has been entered, rather then leave it blank, enter the full adult pricing in case a one of your travelers is a child who is included when pulling from Inventory. <span>(</span>When selecting travelers, be sure to include the type of traveler, <span class="span_2">Adult, Child, Infant</span> from the drop-down menu.)</p>
            <p>For enhanced pricing information on clients' invoices, itemization can also be captured within your inventory detail's pricing area. </p>
            <p><span>Qty:</span> For this inventory record, type in the number of available items. (When you no longer have block space to offer, make sure to come back here and change the quantity to the number you have already sold. That way you won’t accidently sell inventory that is no longer available for sale.)</p>

            <p>In the past, agencies that have been synchronizing with another location were limited to creating and pulling from inventory in only the Primary location. The reason for this limitation was because of the potential to oversell inventory between synchronization processes. To overcome this danger, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> has the ability to allocate available inventory across your various sync databases. Sync activated databases have an additional entry tab in <span class="span_2">Inventory Details</span>, called <span class="span_2">Sync Database Allocation.</span></p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 16 creating and using inventory/creating and using inventory_5.jpg" style="height: 404px;width: 575px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20the%20Inventory%20Manager%20to%20Manage%20Res%20Cards.35.1.08.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Upon creating new Inventory (or updating existing Inventory), look at the count within the <span class="span_2">Available Inventory</span> field. Determine if this inventory should be re-allocated to other sync locations (databases) to facilitate better sales of this inventory. Click the <span class="span_2">Sync Database Allocation</span> tab and <span class="span_2">Re-allocate </span>to re-allocate any quantity available from your current database to any other Sync Copy database.</p>
            <p>The system allocates the inventory to the database the user is connected to. When an agent <span class="span_2">Pulls From Inventory,</span> they are only able to pull inventory allocated to the database they are connected to. As agents use the inventory feature within the Res Card, if they determine that they have a client interested in inventory that is no longer available, they click the <span class="span_2">View Inventory Record</span> and the <span class="span_2">Sync Database Allocation</span> tab to see if there is available inventory in other locations (databases). If so they may suggest re-allocated some of that available inventory to locations (databases) that no longer have any available to them. To re-allocate inventory from one location (database) to another, you must connect to the database that has the available inventory. You can only re-allocate inventory from the database you are connecting to and you can only re-allocate inventory of the database has available inventory records to re-allocate.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Important Note for Agencies Syncing to CBB Hosted:</span> If you are synchronizing to the Hosted <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Browser application, <span>DO NOT</span> allocate inventory to that database unless you are OK with not being able re-allocate it back out of CBB Hosted! <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Browser does not yet include the Inventory Manager and therefore does not have the ability to re-allocate its unused available inventory back to other databases. This means any inventory allocated to CBB Hosted, will have to be sold via CBB Hosted.</p>
            <p>When pulling from Inventory, the system defaults using one of two <span class="span_2">Default Inventory Filters</span>:</p>
            <p>1) <span>Reservation Travel Category</span> - this prompts the Query window with the Travel Category field defaulted to the same category selected in the Reservation. </p>
            <p>2) <span>Res Card Group Name</span> - this now skips the Query window and directly prompts results of ALL inventories (if any) that matches Group Name in the ResCard. You must click <span class="span_2">Query</span> button to change drop-down field default back to <span class="span_2">Reservation Travel Category</span>.</p>

            <p>The Inventory Manager provides tools to manage the database of inventory records. Use the Level 1, 2 and Level 3 Query filters to query the database of inventory records.

            <h3><a name="Level_1_Inventory_Manager_Query" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor40"></a>Level 1 Inventory Manager Query</h3>
            <p>The Level 1 Inventory Manager Query allows you to quickly locate an inventory item or a group of inventory items by simply completing one or two Level 1 Query filters.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 16 creating and using inventory/creating and using inventory_7.jpg" style="height: 142px;width: 461px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20the%20Inventory%20Manager%20to%20Manage%20Res%20Cards.35.1.11.jpg" class="img_1" /> </p>
            <p>The drop-down menu fields identify what to search <span class="span_2">by</span> and are completed by selecting from the following: <span class="span_2">Travel Category, Date Reserved, Vendor, Service Provider, Inventory ID, Description, Duration, Start Date, End Date, Utilization Date, Region, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Group. </span></p>
            <p><span>Include Expired Inventory</span>: By default this checkbox is not checked both in Level 1 and Level 2 Query. This means that by default all Inventory queries no longer include expired inventory from the results unless you place a check in this box.</p>
            <p>The blank field allows you to make your selection from a default pull-down list or type in free-flow information if there is no pull-down list. To prevent spelling errors, it is suggested that you type no more than 3 or 4 characters in the free-flow fields. An arrow to the right of the blank field indicates a list from a pull-down menu exists for ease of selection for that Query filter. If both fields are used in the Query, then the results match both (all) criteria, not either/or (any) criteria. This means the Query filters are strung together with an “and” not an “or.” (Another way of saying this is that <span>All</span> fields are evaluated to form the results of the Query, instead of <span>Any</span> filter selected within one field being evaluated to form the results of the Query.) After completing or changing data in the filters, the system automatically sifts through the database and displays the matching inventory items in the Query results screen.</p>
            <p>For example, if agent Sharon wants to review all her active inventory cruise items created on June 23, 2008 in the system, she sets the first field to <span class="span_2">Travel Type</span> and selects <span class="span_2">Cruise</span> from the pull-down menu list. She sets the second field to <span class="span_2">Date Reserved</span> and June 23, 2008 from the pull-down calendar, or simply free flows the date 0623 (no need to put in the year as it populates with current year), and tab. Finally, she clicks <span class="span_2">Refresh </span>to see a list that matches her selection criteria.</p>
            <p class="p_3">Copy/Paste Inventory Records</p>

            </p>
            <p>To help make entering repetitive inventory easier, copy and paste an Inventory record. From either the Level 1, 2 or Level 3 Query results you can now copy any inventory record by highlighting it and clicking <span class="span_2">Copy</span>. Click <span class="span_2">Paste</span> to automatically create a new Inventory record with all of the copied inventory details defaulting. All inventory fields are copies including all <span class="span_2">General, Itinerary, Payment Due Dates, Itin/Invoice Remarks, Agent Remarks</span> in addition to each <span class="span_2">inventory detail item</span>. The only fields that <span class="span_4">do not</span> copy are the <span class="span_2">Inventory Record Number </span>and the<span class="span_2"> Number Sold</span>.</p>

            <p>The Query Level 2 provides additional filters to more narrowly define a search. Search filters are selected by clicking <span class="span_2">Filter,</span> and then completing as many of the search criteria fields as desired.</p>
            <p>Since Level 2 Query “remembers” the last query run, click <span class="span_2">Reset</span> to clear. Always do this first when doing a Level 2 Query, as there may be data remaining in the many search folders from the last search. Inventory folder tabs such as <span class="span_2">Inventory, Itinerary, Flight Information, Address, </span>and<span class="span_2"> Details </span>are available for selection criteria entry. Query also across all tabs of information. Like Level 1 Query, the selection criteria entered within a tab or across tabs are strung together with “ands”, so the resulting profiles must match <span>ALL not ANY</span> criteria.</p>

            <p>The Level 3 Query provides users with an even greater ability to more narrowly define a search. As detailed above, Level 2 Query allows a search by any number of fields, stringing one statement of criteria together with an "and.” Query Level 3 strings multiple statements of criteria together with an "or," using search method options to define how the criteria should filter. The Level 3 Query has a totally different look from Level 2 Query:</p>

            </p>
            <p>There are a set of buttons including <span class="span_2">Add Filter, Modify Filter, Delete Filter, Reset All</span> (to clear out all filters currently displayed), and <span class="span_2">Summarize</span>. Notice there is nothing to view in the results screen. This is because you need to setup the criteria statement(s) and click Refresh to see the Level 3 Query results. </p>
            <p>To enter the search criteria into Level 3 Query after clicking <span class="span_2">Reset All</span>, click Add Filter: </p>

Directly to the left of the field, is a box with a drop-down menu of search method options called, Operators, with which you can narrow down your search. Sample Operators include: <span class="span_2">Is Equal to; Less than or Equal to; Greater than or Equal to; Less than, Greater than, Not Equal to; Starts With; Contains; Is BLANK; </span><span>and</span><span class="span_2"> Is NOT BLANK.</span> Search fields are strung together with an <span class="span_2">And. </span>Use both tabs to setup the first filter or your query, and click <span class="span_2">OK. </span>Click <span class="span_2">Refresh</span> to see the results of your first filter. </p>
            <p>To set up a second filter, click <span class="span_2">Add. </span>Remember as you are setting up subsequent filters, there is an OR between all the filters you are stringing together.</p>
            <h3><a name="Using_Date_Formulas_in_Queries" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Using Date Formulas in Queries</h3>
            <p>Since queries can be saved and retrieved for frequent use, the date fields in all queries allow for date formulas. This means any field that has a date, can also contain a formula for that date. The date formula function query creation without identifying a specific month, day and year in the <span class="span_2">From</span> and <span class="span_2">To</span> date fields. Instead, the query is processed with a formula for the month, day, day of the week, and year based upon the date the report is processed. </p>
            <p><span>Remember: </span>Make sure the system date and time are correct.</p>
            <p><span>Benefit:</span> When entering a date formula, the system converts it to the intended time period allowing you to run queries and/or save them for future use without the need to modify dates.</p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> The following tables contain sample formulas for specifying dates. Mix and match the absolute and relative parameters in the function. The first number specifies the day of the month, the second number specifies the month, and the third number specifies the year. So if you only have the first number filled in, this means you want this report to reoccur on this day every month in every year.</p>

            <p>As you can see, queries run in the Inventory Manager can become quite complex. With all the available filters in Level 1, 2 and Level 3, you can view your database inside out, upside down or in just about any subset you desire. With this in mind, if there are certain queries that to run often, save the query filters after setting them up, by saving the query to a folder. That way, the next time you want to run a query that you have already setup, click the saved folder. One click and query filters are completed automatically. Following are the steps for saving an inventory query:</p>
            <p>1) Using Level 1, 2 and Level 3 filter parameters in the Inventory Manager, enter query filters and run the query.</p>
            <p>2) To customize the columns used in the query, click <span class="span_2">Columns</span> on the Inventory Manager results screen.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To change a column, move the highlighted column over to the other side by using the <span>&gt;</span> or <span>&lt; </span>arrow. By using the shift key and mouse, select as many consecutive entries as you want to move and use the <span>&gt;</span> or <span>&lt; </span>arrows. By using the control key and your mouse, select non-consecutive entries to move. Use <span>U </span>and <span>D</span> to order your selections. To sort up to 3 columns in ascending or descending order, click the tab folders named, <span class="span_2">Sort by Columns. </span></p>
            <p>You can also arrange and size the columns in your query. Do this by inserting your mouse between the column headers (see a bi-directional arrow), holding down the left mouse button, and pulling the columns to the new size. </p>

            <p>6) Click <span class="span_2">OK </span>to save and see the new query folder located on the left hand side of the Inventory Manager screen:</p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> saves the filters and results layout, <span>not</span> the query results. The next time you use the saved query, any data that has been added or modified since it was created, is included in the new query. </p>
            <h3><a name="Working_with_Query_Results" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Working with Query Results </h3>
            <p>Agents can query for any particular inventory items, select columns and sorts accordingly, and print out the results, by clicking the <span class="span_2">Print</span> icon In the toolbar. </p>
            <p>To add new inventory records, click <span class="span_2">Inventory</span> on the main toolbar, right-click anywhere within the query results and select <span class="span_2">Add</span>, or go to <span>File|New|Inventory</span>. To modify an existing inventory record, use the Level 1, 2 or 3 Query filters (see below) to locate the desired inventory record. Either double-click the inventory record from the query results listing, or highlight the desired inventory record, and then right-click anywhere within the query results and select <span class="span_2">Modify</span>.</p>
            <p>To remove an inventory record, use the Level 1, 2, or 3 Query filters to locate the desired inventory record. Highlight the inventory item to delete and either click <span class="span_2">Delete</span> icon on the toolbar, or right click anywhere within the query results and select <span class="span_2">Delete</span>. You are prompted for confirmation since if there are any reservations linked to the inventory record, the system does not allow deletion. </p>
            <p><span>Special Note:</span> The delete inventory feature removes the entire inventory record along with ALL inventory details. To delete a specific inventory detail, do NOT delete from the results of the Inventory Manager Query. Retrieve the desired inventory record and from within that record, highlight the inventory detail to remove, and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>.</p>
            <h2><a name="How_to_Multi-Select_Records" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>How to Multi-Select Records</h2>
            <p>To multi-select records from the results of a query, use the CTRL key in combination with a mouse click. Notice one of three symbols next to each profile as you push CTRL and click it: </p>
            <p>a) Bullet - this profile has been selected.</p>
            <p>b) Bullet and Bracket - this profile has been selected and is the current profile record the cursor is focused on. </p>
            <p>c) Solid Triangle - this profile has NOT been selected as part of the multi-select, but is the current record the cursor is focused on. CTRL-click once to get the bullet and bracket, and a second time if you choose not to include in the multi-select after all. </p>
            <p>Also use the main edit menu or right-mouse click the results screen to <span class="span_2">Select</span> <span class="span_2">All</span>, <span class="span_2">Unselect All</span> or<span class="span_2"> Inverse</span>.</p>
            <p>To delete multiple inventory records, use the multi-select feature, and click <span class="span_2">Delete </span>on the toolbar. This permanently deletes these highlighted records at one time. If there are reservations linked to the inventory record you are trying to delete, the system does not permit deletion. The delete inventory feature removes the entire inventory record along with ALL inventory details. To delete a specific inventory detail, do NOT delete from the results of the Inventory Manager Query. Retrieve the desired inventory record and from within that record, highlight the inventory detail to remove, and click <span class="span_2">Delete</span>.</p>

            <p>Once a database of inventory records has been setup, agents can connect to this database of inventory while working in the Res Card. To query inventory for a particular client's trip, open a Res Card for that client and select the travelers. Click the <span class="span_2">Inventory</span> icon. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Upon clicking the Inventory button from the Res Card level, the system either provides you with the ability to query for your desired inventory (see below), or, if a Group has been captured within the Res Card, the query may be performed automatically if you have the <span class="span_2">Default Inventory Filter</span> set to <span class="span_2">Res Card Group Name. </span></p>
            <p>If you need to search for Inventory, use any inventory header fields as filters (search criteria), as well as itinerary/flight/address info and inventory detail information. Each filter entered into the query fields is "anded" together with other filters, so any results match all filters. The more filters entered, the narrower the search and generally fewer results. The fewer filters entered, the more general the search and generally more results. </p>
            <p>The <span class="span_2">Default Inventory Filter </span>that you can use <span class="span_2">to </span>pick from two possible default filters when pulling from inventory has the options, <span class="span_2">Reservation Travel Category</span> and <span class="span_2">Res Card Group Name</span>. This is a "sticky" setting so that each time you pull from inventory the system remembers the last setting and defaults accordingly.</p>

            <p>You can also pull inventory from inside a reservation, but make sure the travelers are correct before you pull (check off those who are going to be in the reservation, and uncheck any traveler that is not going to be in that reservation) and then click <span class="span_2">Inventory</span>: </p>

            <p>Once your Inventory query criteria has been captured, the system prompts with matching Inventory details and from this results screen, the system now allows you to select any number of Inventory details by placing an<span> X</span> in the box within the column labeled <span class="span_2">Pull from Inventory</span>. </p>

            <p>As you select each Inventory detail desired, the <span class="span_2">Pull From Inventory</span> button's count is increased accordingly. To view more information about any inventory detail, click <span class="span_2">View Inventory Record</span> at the bottom right hand corner. Once all desired Inventory is selected, click <span class="span_2">Pull From Inventory</span>, and the system imports each inventory detail into a separate reservation record and the available inventory is decreased accordingly. Please note that although the system allows for pulling more than one inventory detail at once, each inventory detail is linked to a separate reservation and maintained separately; therefore, each are returned to inventory individually by either cancelling or deleting the reservation.</p>

            <p>Combining this feature with the ability to group multiple inventory records together with a common group name gives you the ability to batch separate inventory records together and therefore ease the process of selling and pulling inventory that are all associated but include multiple components or vendors. Agencies that need to track multiple components (for vendor payment and sales purposes), but do not wish to break down the pricing of each component on their client invoices, can use the <span class="span_2">Invoice Format</span> option <span class="span_2">Hide Reservation Totals</span> (include only <span class="span_2">Invoice Totals</span>), upon invoicing these types of transactions. </p>
            <p>The link to that inventory detail remains permanent, unless the reservation is deleted, or the reservation status is changed to <span class="span_2">Cancelled</span> or <span class="span_2">Quoted</span>, at which time you are prompted for confirmation and if accepted, the link removed and the inventory replaced back into <span class="span_2">Available</span> inventory.</p>

            <p>Launch Live Connect from the reservation screen if the reservation was pulled from Inventory. This allows agencies to track sales of blocked space via inventory and still utilize the Res Card data to populate Live Connect. (Currently, this feature is only supported for Sabre Cruises.) </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 16 creating and using inventory/creating and using inventory_20.jpg" style="height: 117px;width: 299px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20the%20Inventory%20Manager%20to%20Manage%20Res%20Cards.35.1.24.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>From a reservation created via inventory, when the <span class="span_2">Pull From Inventory and Launch Live Connect</span> is clicked, the user is prompted, <span class="span_2">This reservation is linked to inventory. Do you want to continue with Live Connect?</span></p>
            <p>When Live Connect is launched, the user can select <span class="span_2">Create New</span>, select the desired checkboxes, and <span class="span_2">Connect</span>. The rate code is passed as part of process, so the user will land directly on the <span class="span_2">Cabin</span> web page. Profile data will also populate the Sabre Cruise website. Once the reservation is confirmed and the user clicks <span class="span_2">Import Reservation</span>, if any differences between the ClientBase reservation and the Live Connect reservation exist, a table is displayed showing the differences between the two:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 16 creating and using inventory/creating and using inventory_21.jpg" style="height: 315px;width: 530px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20the%20Inventory%20Manager%20to%20Manage%20Res%20Cards.35.1.25.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>The user then has three options: </p>
            <p><span>Retain Link: </span>This keeps link to the Inventory record, but any differences in the booking imported via Sabre Cruises overwrite the reservation details that were created from Inventory. </p>
            <p><span>Remove Link: </span>This link releases the inventory record and the booking imported via Sabre Cruise replaces the reservation created from Inventory. </p>
            <p><span>Re-Query Inventory:</span> This allows the user to query for a different Inventory record and pull it into the Reservation, releasing the former Inventory. Any differences in the booking imported from Sabre Cruises will overwrite the reservation details created from Inventory. </p>
            <p>If Live Connect is launched, <span class="span_2">Import Existing</span> <span class="span_2">Reservation </span>is also supported, but, there is no deep linking to the <span class="span_2">Cabin</span> page. When <span class="span_2">Import Existing</span> is selected from the reservation, the booking that matches the confirmation number is imported and the user gets the same prompt to <span class="span_2">Remove Link, Retain Link, or Re-Query Inventory</span>. If <span class="span_2">Import Existing </span>is selected from the res card, a new reservation is created. </p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> Live Connect now transmits the following information for Reservations that were pulled from Inventory: Group ID, Rate Code, Category, Deck, Currency Code, Start Date, Duration (calculated from Start and End dates), Vendor and Ship Name. </p>

            <p>You are now able to import Sabre Cruise Group Contracts into Inventory. The Inventory Manager shopping cart button will now display two options:<span class="span_2"> Create ClientBase Inventory</span>, and <span class="span_2">Import Group Contract from Sabre Cruises</span>. </p>

            </p>
            <p>When the latter option is chosen, the Live Connect screen will launch. Once the user connects to Sabre Cruises, they will land directly on the Group Contract screen. Users will have the option to link the inventory record to a ClientBase Group if desired. Import will be possible for all travel categories for which we have Inventory: Air, Cruise, Hotel, Rail, Tour, and Misc. </p>
            <p>There is also an option to import a group contract from Sabre Cruises to the Create Inventory button. &#160; Added a Group Inventory option to the <span>File|Import</span> menu.&#160; In <span>Global Defaults|Group List,</span> there is an Inventory Group ID field. If an Inventory Group has been linked to a Group ID in an Inventory record, the Group ID will display there as well.</p>
