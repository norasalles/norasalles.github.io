            <p class="p_2">This chapter describes how to setup, maintain and use Vendor and Service Provider type profiles.</p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..41" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Vendor profiles provide an easily accessible source for an agency to store pertinent information about its travel suppliers. Tour operators, cruise lines, hotels and car rental companies are some examples of vendor profiles. All the important details about these vendor are stored in one convenient place that everyone in the office can access. Key information such as phone numbers, rep contacts, supplier addresses, commission information, specials, preferred vendor status and cancel policies may be included in the profile.</p>
            <p>Service Provider profiles represent the various components of a trip booked through a specific vendor. For example, the service provider for a Carnival Cruise booking would be the Carnival Destiny. Pertinent details about the Destiny would be stored in this type of profile and therefore accessible to everyone at the agency. Feedback from other travelers can be added in and accessed by all agents to better service future clients. Since some service providers could be booked by multiple vendors once the profile is created, it can be linked to one or more vendor profiles. For example, the Hilton Hawaiian Village could be booked through Pleasant Holidays or Classic Custom Vacation, etc. and once created as a service provider, can be associated with all these vendor profiles for easy access to the information. In some cases, a vendor may also be a service provider, like in the case of the Hilton Hawaiian Village.</p>
            <p>Why do we go to such lengths to differentiate between a vendor or service provider? It is so that client comments and feedback can be attached to specific service provider profiles, and the agency can obtain service provider reports. Instead of getting a report of how many clients went on a vendor (Carnival for example), obtain a report of how many people travelled on each of the vendor’s service providers (Ecstasy, Destiny, Triumph, etc.) as well. Also, when entering reservation information into the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card, agents can capture vendor level information, and if desired, service provider level information. For example, an agent can point to the vendor profile for Carnival Cruise Lines while identifying the vendor for the reservation and can point to the Ecstasy when identifying the service provider. </p>
            <p>In the past, agencies kept track of this vendor and service provider information in a variety of ways. Some agents used rolodexes with vendor and service provider special contact names and lists of phone numbers for each department. Other agents had folders which included brochures, specials, as well as any communication information they were able to obtain for each of the vendors and service providers. Still other agents memorized vital vendor and service provider information.</p>
            <p>When a customer travels with a particular service provider and feedback information on its services, how is this information distributed to your agents? Is there one place an agent can go that summarizes what customers felt about a particular trip or service? With <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, all vendor and service provider information is in one place for all agents. By creating rich, information-filled profiles for the vendors and service providers, each agent has quick access to this vital information. </p>
            <h2><a name="Anatomy_of_Vendor_Service_Provider_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Anatomy of Vendor/Service Provider Profile</h2>
            <p>A vendor profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> stores an unlimited amount of information about your vendors and service providers. To organize all this information and make it easily accessible to all agents, each profile is made up of seven key areas - <span class="span_2">Toolbar, Header Info, Scrolling Arrows, Indicator Icons, Control Buttons, Information Tabs, and User-Defined Fields.</span></p>

            </p>
            <p>Let’s explore each of these seven key areas.</p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Launch a Website:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Website</span> to launch the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Internet Manager and the vendor/service provider’s website. (You must have entered the website URL in the <span class="span_2">Website </span>under the communication area.) Copy any information on the website to keep in the profile by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;c&gt; on your keyboard (or right mouse click and copy). Then paste that data into the profile by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;v&gt; on your keyboard (or right mouse click and paste). Make sure to make this website the <span class="span_2">Primary</span> website to activate this feature.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Reminder:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Remind</span> to create a reminder for the vendor/service provider such as checking on brochure shipment. Fill in the date to be reminded, the priority, reminder type, an optional alarm and finally type in some free-flowing remarks for reference. There is an option to mark this reminder “Private” so that only the creation agent or SYSDBA can view it. This reminder appears on queries in the activity manager or reports.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Note:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Note</span> to create a "Post-it" note documenting an important contact had with a vendor/service provider. By entering the date, time, and subject of the contact, a history of contacts is created which appears in the Activity Manager or reports.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Mailer:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Mailer</span> to create a history documenting mailings sent to a vendor/service provider. By entering the date, time, and subject of the mailer, a "tickler" created which appears in the Activity Manager or reports.</p>
            <p><span>Print:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Print</span> to print out details of the vendor/service provider profile.</p>
            <p><span>Merge to Label:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Label</span> to create a label for the vendor/service provider.</p>
            <p><span>Merge to Document Template:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Letter</span> to merge vendor/service provider name and address to any letter contained in the document templates. The master of the letter can be customized if desired by the user for a personalized touch.</p>
            <p><span>Merge to E-mail:</span> Click <span class="span_2">E-mail</span> to merge vendor/service provider’s primary e-mail address into an e-mail screen.</p>
            <h3><a name="Header_Information_..43" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Header Information</h3>

            </p>
            <p>The header conveniently displays pertinent information including the current mailing address, the first five communication entries captured for this profile, number of Marketing Codes, Primary Contact, Groups, Profile Create Date, Salutation, Interface ID, and Profile No. </p>
            <p>The header displays the first five Communication entries, in the order they are listed on the profile's Communications tab. If there are not five entries at the profile level, then the primary contact's communications are displayed next, in the order they are listed on the primary contact's communications tab. If there still are not 5 communications to display, then ClientBase picks up from the other contacts listed on the Contacts tab, in the order they are listed there, until all five slots are filled. </p>
            <p>The items in the header are clickable. When clicked, the user is taken to that section of the profile. For example, when the Marketing Codes count is clicked, the Marketing tab opens; when the Primary Contact is clicked, that Contact record opens. </p>

            <p>There are many fields in vendor/service provider profiles that can be customized for agency’s use. While other data entry fields are labelled in black, user-defined fields stand out because they are labeled in blue. By going into the <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields</span> area or simply double-clicking on the blue label before the field, detailed lists can be created for agent access in the form of drop-down menus. This gives an agency greater flexibility for entering vendor/service provider information.</p>

            <p><span class="span_2">Type</span><span class="span_2">:</span> Indicate the type of profile by clicking the drop-down menu. Choices include vendor or service provider.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Company</span><span class="span_2">:</span> Enter the name of vendor/service provider. Any printed reports or labels include the <span class="span_2">Company</span> name entered here.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Last Name</span><span>:</span> Enter last name of primary contact. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">First Name</span><span>:</span> Enter first name of the primary contact.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">MI</span><span>: </span>Enter the middle initial of the primary contact.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Courtesy Title</span><span>:</span> Mr., Mrs., Mr. &amp; Mrs., Ms., Dr. are all examples of courtesy titles. This field can be customized by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Courtesy Title</span> or clicking on the blue field label.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Address 1, Address 2:</span> A vendor profile includes an unlimited number of addresses designated as Primary, Bill To, Ship To, Second Address and Alternate Address. Only one address though may be assigned as Primary, Bill To, or Ship To.</p>
            <p>Assuming the address to be captured is the default type of <span class="span_2">Primary, Bill To </span>and <span class="span_2">Ship To</span>, then the address fields of <span class="span_2">Address Line 1</span>, <span class="span_2">Address Line 2</span>, <span class="span_2">Apt/Suite, Zip Code, City, State </span>and <span class="span_2">Country </span>can be entered right from the main screen. To capture additional address entries, such as a second address or alternate address, click <span class="span_2">Additional Addresses</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Apt/Suite:</span> Enter the appropriate unit number.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">City/State/Zip:</span> Enter the city/state/zip data. These fields can be customized by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|City/State/Zip </span>or click on the blue field label.</p>
            <h4><a name="PROFILE_STATUS_..49" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>PROFILE STATUS</h4>
            <p><span class="span_2">Create Date/Create User:</span> These fields default to the system date and the user logged in at the time the profile is created. Both can be modified, but can be disabled by the database administrator. Agencies use this field to query for new customers so that “Welcome to the Agency" letters can be mailed. These fields can also be used to query for management reports reflecting user productivity in creating new client profiles. </p>
            <p><span>Last Modified User/Last Modified Date: </span>This area indicates the last time a profile was modified and by whom.</p>
            <p><span>Profile Status: </span>Indicate whether a customer profile is active or inactive by choosing from the drop-down menu. By default all profiles start with an active status. An inactive status has been included, since you cannot delete a profile that has invoices and payments attached. When querying, only profiles marked as active are included in the search, but you can perform a Level 2 search to view inactive profiles.</p>

            <p><span class="span_2">Branch No.:</span> For agencies with multiple branches, enter the branch number (if applicable) from the drop-down menu. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Interface ID</span><span>: </span>In order to easily and consistently identify an existing customer or vendor within different applications used within the agency (<span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, your GDS, your Back Office etc.), a unique ID should be assigned to each profile. This ID is called the "Interface ID". As an example, this field is associated with the interfacing of records generated from the GDS (Front Office) to the agency accounting system (Back Office). If your agency works with client or vendor data within multiple systems then we strongly suggest creating a unique Interface ID for each profile. This field can be set as <span class="span_2">Required</span> and a default <span class="span_2">Value</span> can be automatically assigned when new profiles are created (see chapter <span class="span_2">Setting Up ClientBase for Your Agency)</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Salutation:</span> The name used to greet the vendor/service provider contact; for example, if Mr. Henry Wilkenson likes to be called “Hank,” enter <span class="span_2">Hank</span> in this field.

            </p>
            <p>If you were on a previous version of ClientBase, communications have been moved out of the General Info tab of the Contact record into its own tab. The Primary Phone, Primary E-mail, Primary Fax, and Primary Web are now displayed in the list of Contacts on the Contacts tab in the profile. The first Communication entry of a given type is marked as the Contact's Primary (Primary box checked). Subsequent communication entries of that type default to unchecked. </p>
            <p>By using the radio button on the top of the results screen, users can filter to view only one communications type at a time. Profile-level communication entries are displayed first, followed by the communications that are assigned to contacts. Contact communications are in the order that the contacts are listed in the Contacts tab. Profile level communications can be sorted using the blue arrows on the right side of the screen. These arrows are disabled when a Contact communication entry is selected. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Add, Modify, </span>or <span class="span_2">Delete</span> a communication entry. Deleting a communication entry works the same as before, unless the Contact is linked to more than one profile.

            <p>Here is another area where unlimited, free-flowing agency remarks can be entered. Whenever agents use this profile, they can access what other agents have written about this vendor or service provider. Such information is valuable so that each agent benefits from the collective experience gained by all customers and agents.</p>
            <h3><a name="Marketing_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor309"></a>Marketing Tab</h3>
            <p>The Marketing Tab provides a way to track vendors by adding data about the supplier in a manner that agents can Query. For example, in the A &amp; K profile, check off destinations that can be booked for this vendor, or a budget category this vendor falls in, or the type of travel this vendor sells. Then when searching for a vendor that meets the client's requirements, an agent can Query on these specific Marketing Codes.</p>
            <p>When first installing <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, default marketing tables and codes are located in the marketing tab. These default tables/codes can be modified, enhanced, or deleted. The default tables are included to give users basic ideas about what information might be effective. For instructions on tailoring user-definable Marketing Tables and Marketing Codes, please refer to the chapter of this manual entitled, <span class="span_2">Setting Up ClientBase for Your Agency</span>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <span class="span_2">Contact </span>folder is designed for detailed information on specific individuals who are key contacts with a vendor/service provider. The blue up-and-down arrows allow re-ordering the list of contacts. Vendor profiles have a "Reset Sorting" button which returns the list to alphabetical order. By highlighting a particular contact, you’ll be able to see any remarks entered in the contact record.</p>
            <p>Add a new traveler/contact by clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>. When a user adds a new contact record, the database is first automatically searched for any existing travelers/contacts that match. If a match is found, the user can select the existing contact from the list presented and click <span class="span_2">Link </span>to link the existing traveler/contact. They may also click <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> to return to their new traveler/contact. </p>
            <p>When clicking <span class="span_2">OK</span> again, the new traveler/contact is created. Any data that was entered while creating the new traveler/contact that did not exist in the linked traveler/contact record will be transferred.</p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> An agent enters a passport number when entering a new traveler/contact. The agent clicks OK, and search finds an existing traveler/contact record, but the existing record does not have a passport number. When the agent selects the matching traveler/contact record, and data from the traveler/contact record is populated on the screen, the passport information that was missing is now completed also.</p>
            <p><span>Conversely:</span> If data was entered and the existing traveler/contact record contains information in that field, the existing traveler/contact data is retained. <span class="span_2">Example:</span> Agent enters First Name, Last Name, and a birthdate of July 1, 1960, and then clicks OK. The traveler/contact Search results screen appears, and the agent decides to select one of the existing traveler/contact records. The existing traveler has a birthdate of April 12, 1965. The existing birthdate information overwrites the one the agent entered. (Users can always go back and edit if the original information was incorrect.)</p>
            <p>To modify or enhance a contact, click <span class="span_2">Modify</span> while the name is highlighted. If <span class="span_2">Unlink</span> is clicked for a traveler/contact that is not linked to any other profiles, then a prompt is presented warning that the traveler/contact will be deleted completely. If <span class="span_2">Unlink</span> is clicked for a traveler/contact that is linked to more than one profile, then a confirmation prompt is presented, advising that the traveler/contact will continue to exist in the other linked profiles. </p>
            <p>By click the <span class="span_2">Search </span>button, you can search for a contact that is located in another profile and attach the contact to this profile as well. </p>

            <p>.A birthday present icon appears during the traveler's birthday month and disappears once the birthday month has passed. A red exclamation point icon appears if the traveler has an expired passport or credit card. Clicking on the exclamation point icon takes the user to Card record if it's an expired credit card, or to the Advanced Traveler Info tab if it's an expired passport. The icon disappears when the expiration date is updated. </p>

            <p><span>TIPS: </span>Search by phone or e-mail address alone, or in combination with any of the name fields. If searching by name only, users must enter something in at least two of the three name fields.</p>
            <p class="p_5">Examples: </p>
            <p>**User enters First Name of Ken and an e-mail address of ken@example.com. Ken Able, who has that address, is returned; Ken Jones, who does not have that e-mail address, is not.</p>
            <p>**User knows the last name, but isn't sure exactly how the first name is spelled. He enters First Name A and last name Smith. All Travelers whose first name starts with A (Alice, Anne, Alex,) and last name starts with Smith (Smith, Smith-Jones) are returned.</p>
            <p>**User knows that Mary Anne Jones has married, but doesn't remember the Traveler's new last name. She enters First Name Mary and Middle Name Anne. All Travelers with that first and middle name are returned.</p>

            <p>To enhance the amount and type of information accessible in a <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile, a feature is included in all profile types allowing you to point to other files available on a local or network drive. These files are referred to as <span class="span_2">Attachments</span>. Attachments are listed alphabetically by <span class="span_2">Description</span>, and can be sorted from the drop-down menu by <span class="span_2">Description, File Name, Directory Path, Computer Name, Original File Source, Compressed Size, File Date/Time, or Modified Date/Time.</span> </p>
            <p>To add a new attachment click <span class="span_2">Add</span>, and <span class="span_2">Browse for Attachment </span>to identity the file path of the file. The file path includes the drive where the file is located, any directories or sub-directories, and the name of the file. Choose to compress the file by clicking <span class="span_2">Compression</span>. Enter a brief description of the attachment, if desired. When retrieving a profile and viewing attachments, the attachments are listed alphabetically by <span class="span_2">Description</span>.</p>

            <p>To view a saved attachment, highlight the attachment, and click <span class="span_2">Open Attachment </span>or double-click on attachment to open. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses Windows association to view the file type, load the appropriate software, and retrieve the specified file. Every file has an extension (e.g., .doc, .jpg, .bmp, .html, etc.) that must be associated with a specific Windows software program such as MS Word, Paint Shop Pro, Internet Explorer, etc. to be viewed. Although this association is created automatically by Windows when various software programs are installed, if a workstation does not have a software program associated with the type of file an attachment is pointing to, then the file cannot be viewed from the attachment created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. </p>
            <p>Modifications to a file launched from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> attachments can be saved automatically back into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. If an attachment is opened and then modified and saved, upon closing the attachment you land on the attachment settings window. Clicking <span class="span_2">OK </span>from this area saves the newly modified file back to <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.
