            <p class="p_2">Successful system usage depends on proper hardware, setup and installation. This section walks you through the steps necessary to successfully install ClientBase on your agency’s local area network. Please be sure to read this chapter carefully, verify your system meets the hardware requirements, and follow the steps exactly. </p>

            <p><span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> shares a database with the <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> system and therefore also uses Interbase as the underlying engine.  Depending on when you installed <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>, you may still be running an older version of Interbase. This new version of <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> has been optimized for system performance to run on the latest Interbase version. To verify your version of Interbase, log into <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> and go to<span class="span_1"> Help|Table Version</span> and check the field <span class="span_1">IB Server Version. </span>To upgrade your Interbase when you are running an earlier version with TBO, contact our support desk and directions below to upgrade. </p>
            <h4><a name="Canadian_Users" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor273"></a>Canadian Users</h4>
            <p>The Canadian version of <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> is available in French, in addition to English. Upon installing version 3.03 or above update on each workstation, a second desktop shortcut is created automatically called <span class="span_1">CBPlus French</span>. Now French speaking agents can either run <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> in English or in French. Although the majority of the program has been translated to French, the invoice is the only report in <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> that prints in anything other than English. Please note that both the English and the French version of <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> include the Invoice Format option of printing an invoice in any of the following languages: English, French or Spanish. </p>
            <p>The CBPlusfre.exe is installed in the same directory as cbplus.exe. On the desktop where the CBPlus shortcut is installed and in the <span class="span_1">Trams</span> program group (folder under start/programs/etc) where the CBPlus shortcut is installed, a CBPlus French shortcut also appears.</p>

            <h2><a name="Hardware_Requirements" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor274"></a>Hardware Requirements</h2>
            <p>Your customers and the information you collect from them are the heart of your business. <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> is designed to help your agency quickly access and manage this information by making it available to everyone within your business. With this in mind, most agencies install the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> program on multiple workstations, including all agent workstations.</p>
            <p>Although the program is installed in multiple locations, the objective is to centralize this customer information so that all workstations access one common database. In this scenario, the computer housing the database (<span class="span_1">trams</span>.ib) is considered the “server” and the computers set up to run <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> and access that database are considered the “clients”. Regardless of the number of clients running <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>, the hardware recommendations for the <span class="span_1">workstations</span> remain constant. Unlike the workstations, server’s hardware recommendations vary, depending on the number of clients (workstations) set up to work within the database simultaneously. </p>

            <h3><a name="What_is_a_Database_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>What is a Database?</h3>
            <p>All of the Profile, Activity, and Res Card details captured within your <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> program get stored within one file, which resides on your <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> server. This file is commonly referred to as your database and, because it is an InterBase database, always has a file extension of .ib (earlier versions had an extension of .gdb). InterBase is the engine that the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> program is built around.</p>
            <p>Although it is not necessarily recommended, if for some reason you wanted to break your information into multiple databases, you would have multiple files on your server, one for each database. Each of these files would have a common file extension (ib or gdb if you already have TBO), but different file names.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3><a name="What_is_an_ib_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>What is an ib?</h3>
            <p>IB is used as the file extension for an Interbase database. Upon running the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> program, a login screen appears allowing you to identify the database that you want to load within the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> program. The file that represents your database will have an .ib extension unless you are already running Trams Back Office, in which case you retain the .gdb extension you have been using with Trams Back Office.</p>
            <p>If you are a <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> user the database has already been created and is probably called <span class="span_1">Trams</span>.ib or for older versions .gdb and resides in the \<span class="span_1">Trams</span>\<span class="span_1">Trams</span>win directory. This database file can be used within the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> program eliminating the inefficiencies of maintaining two separate databases in your office.</p>
            <p>If you are not a <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> user, then a blank <span class="span_1">Trams</span>.ib file is created upon installing <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> onto your server. </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3><a name="What_is_an_Alias_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor276"></a>What is an Alias?</h3>
            <p>An alias is a path pointing to your database. The alias stores a name for your database and a path to find that database on the server. Each time you open the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> program or <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>, you are prompted for the alias you want to use. Select the alias from the drop-down menu of database names. The executable program looks at the associated path and follows that path to connect to your data. An Alias with the name of <span class="span_1">Trams</span> is created by default during installation.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3><a name="What_is_Interbase" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor277"></a>What is Interbase</h3>
            <p>Interbase is best described as the database operating system. It is the foundation upon which <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> and <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> run. This foundation is responsible for the structure of the database, storing the data, any maintenance and utilities applied to the database, connecting the application program to the database and file locking on the network to save the integrity of the database.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h2><a name="Set_Up_the_ClientBase_Server" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor278"></a>Set Up the ClientBase Server</h2>
            <h3><a name="The_Role_of_the_ClientBase_Server" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>The Role of the ClientBase Server</h3>
            <p><span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> is a true client/server application. This means the workstations are “clients” and rather than doing their own processing of information, they send a query to the “server,” the server processes the query, and sends the results back to the workstation. Because the server is only sending results instead of the full database across the network, applications designed for Client/Server are faster and more powerful. The server is the computer housing the database, and the clients are the workstations set up to run the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> application program.</p>
            <p>Although the workstations need certain resources to run the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> executable and display the screens of information when queries are performed, the server is doing most of the work. The more workstations performing simultaneous queries, the harder the server must work. The harder the server must work, the more resources the server needs to perform the work in a timely fashion. </p>
            <p>Therefore, there is a direct relationship between the number of workstations accessing <span class="span_1">ClientBase </span>simultaneously and the type of hardware an agency needs for their <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> server. In the past, it was common for one of the agent workstations to function as the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> server. This type of networking is still available, but is limited to smaller networks of five or fewer workstations. Please refer to the hardware recommendations located at the beginning of this chapter to determine what kind of server is necessary for your agency configuration.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h3><a name="Selecting_the_Right_Server_for_ClientBase" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Selecting the Right Server for ClientBase</h3>
            <p>When deciding which computer should function as your <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> server, the following items should be considered:</p>
            <ul class="ul_1">
                <li class="ListParagraph_1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The Server PC must meet the hardware recommendations (at least the minimum), based upon the number of users accessing the database.</li>
                <li class="ListParagraph_1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The Server PC must be accessible by any workstation set up to run <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> through the agency’s LAN (Local Area Network.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Server PC houses the database (ib or gdb if running TBO for many years), which is shared with the <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> program. This means if your agency uses <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> as your accounting system, both programs (<span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> and <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>) access the same database. Therefore, the server PC, which houses this common database, must be accessible via the network by any workstations setup to run either <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> or <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>.</p>

            <p><i>ClientBase</i> will automatically install updates when they become available. Auto-update greatly streamlines installing updates on users' workstations and ensures fixes are being installed in a timely manner. Auto-update will only install updates that match the current major version (4.09.01 or 4.08.02, for example).</p>
            <p>When <i>ClientBase</i> is launched, the auto-update feature checks to see if a newer version is available, then automatically downloads and installs the update on the users' workstation. The automatic update works for <i>tramswin</i>, <i>download</i>, <i>ibbackup</i> and the <i>ibbackuplib</i> files. The earlier versions of the executables will be renamed by appending <i>.old</i> to the file name during the process, so they are available to roll back to an earlier version, if necessary.</p>
            <p>Users can postpone the auto-update for 24 hours or 1 week; after which they will be prompted again that an update is available.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span class="span_3"><b>*Note</b>: </span>If a user does not have administrative rights, the auto-update routine won't be able to install the new versions. You can get around this by giving users Read &amp; Execute, List folder contents, Read, Write, Modify Security permissions to the Trams folder, subfolders and files in which <i>ClientBase</i> is installed (e.g., <i>C:\Program Files (x86)\Trams\</i>).</p>

            <p>Upon installation of <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>, by default all queries are automatically enabled in each of four managers (Profile, Activity, Res Card, and Inventory), as well as in the Profile Travel History tab, Profile Payment History tab, and on the Profile Indicator buttons. If your database contains more than 25,000 profiles, you may want to consider disabling this automatic Query option for optimum performance. To do this globally, go to <span>Global Defaults|Automatic Query Settings</span> and select <span class="span_1">Disable</span> from the drop-down menu for any of the queries that you do not want to run automatically.</p>

            <h2><a name="Credit_Card_Encryption" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor290"></a>Credit Card Encryption</h2>
            <p>Starting in <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> Version 3.4 and <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> 3.01, upon installation or updating of both versions of these programs, credit card numbers become encrypted and masked within the database. In an effort to protect your clients from credit card fraud, and to comply with recent PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliance regulations, all credit card numbers within your database have been (and will be) encrypted and masked. To a typical <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> user this encryption appears invisible, but it makes the extraction of this personal data much more difficult should your database be accessed in an unauthorized manner. Upon retrieving a credit card number within the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> application, the system automatically decrypts the credit card number and display the full number as always. (Please note the User Permission details below where users can be forced to only view the masked version of the credit card number.)</p>
            <h3><a name="Introduction_..124" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance and validation regulations spells out what security measures must be taken to protect the private information during any transaction occurring with the use of a paycard. The PCI Data Security Standard is used by all card brands to ensure the security of the data gathered when transacting on behalf of a customer.</p>
            <p>There are numerous regulations including encrypting the credit card numbers in the database. Encrypting this data makes it virtually impossible to decipher a credit card number without a decryption key which protects the credit card information in your database from fraudulent abuse.</p>
            <h3><a name="How_it_Works" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>How it Works</h3>
            <p>Upon upgrading your database to previous versions of ClientBase Windows 3.04 or above and Trams Back Office 3.01 or above, credit numbers become encrypted and masked within the database. In an effort to protect your clients from credit card fraud, and to comply with recent PCI (Payment Card Industry) Compliance regulations, all credit card numbers within your database have been encrypted and masked. </p>
            <p>To a typical <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> User this encryption appears invisible, but it makes the extraction of this personal data much more difficult should your database be accessed in an unauthorized manner. Upon retrieving a Credit Number within the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> application, the system will automatically decrypt the credit card number and display the full number as always. Please note the User Permission enhancement below where Users can be forced to only view the masked version of the Credit Card number. Also note that encryption and masking <span>only takes place once your database is upgraded to TBO 3.01 or above and then upgraded to 3.04, in this order.</span> </p>
            <p><span>If you are not a TBO subscriber and would like to enable the credit card encryption features you need to download the tfwup.exe file</span> and run this on your database to upgrade it to the appropriate TBO 3.01 version:</p>
            <p class="p_3">http://static.trams.com/releaseandupdatefiles/pub/updates/misc_exe/TFWUp(latestversion)/TFWUp.exe</p>
            <p>Summary of steps after doing a backup of your database: 1) Install <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> Update on Server, 2) Run the tfwup.exe on database, 3) Run the cbplusup.exe on database, 4) Install the Update on each Workstation.</p>
            <p>Upon installation of the <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> program or after running the cbplusup.exe (for clients who are updating their <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> version), the credit card data that was stored in the credit card field pre-encryption now contains a masked version of the credit card number. A new field is also added to the database. The full credit card number is copied from the existing field to the new field and then encrypted. A cleaning and masking routine takes place during the database update to standardize all of the credit card numbers so they can be properly masked for all applications utilizing the masked Credit Card field. Only valid credit card numbers are cleaned and appear in the masked format. </p>
            <p><span class="span_4">The valid credit cards are standardized using these rules:</span> </p>
            <ul class="ul_1">
                <li class="ListParagraph_1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Any non-numeric text at the beginning of the string up to the first digit is stripped out. AX 3782 078 234 0834/1008 becomes 3782 078 234 0834/1008. </li>
                <li class="ListParagraph_1" style="font-size: 10pt;">All spaces are removed. 3782 078 234 0834/1008 becomes 37820782340834/1008. </li>
                <li class="ListParagraph_1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The credit card string is truncated starting at the first non-numeric character, usually a slash, leaving only digits. 37820782340834/1008 becomes 37820782340834. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p_10">The format used for masking is:</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="p_10">Three fields in the database relating to the credit card number:</p>

            <p>All other User Logins have their current password converted to their login name (which is always Upper Case). As each user first logs into <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>, they will need to use their newly converted password based on their login name. For example, if the User Login name is MARY, upon first logging into <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>, the user should enter MARY into the Login Name <span>AND</span> enter MARY into the password. Upon successfully entering the User Login and Password the user is then prompted to enter a new password, to ensure security going forward. This new password is then used each time the user logs into <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>. Because the database is EUA enabled, all users can now update their own User Login passwords by going to <span>Utilities|Setup|User Profile</span> and entering a new password.</p>
            <p>A new setting was added to the Utilities menu called User Login Password Settings. When "Enable Password Expiration" is checked, you can set up how often (number of days) a password should expire. If a User Login password expires as a result of this setting, upon login the user will be prompted to enter the current login and password and then enter (and re-enter) a new password. This setting must be turned on by a user with manager authorization.</p>
            <h4><a name="Password_Expiration" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Password Expiration</h4>
            <p>Enter the number of days until password is expired (Example: 30, 60, 90, etc.). Once password expires, when user tries to login user is directed to a new page and asked to enter the old password and a new password.</p>
            <h4><a name="Password_Strength" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Password Strength</h4>

            <h5><a name="Blacklisted_Passwords" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Blacklisted Passwords</h5>
            <p>For security purposes certain passwords are no longer allowed to be used in the database.</p>
            <p>The old password that came with the installation letter, mas****** is <span class="span_4">no longer allowed</span> for use as a password for SYSDBA. After EUA enabling the database, if the SYSDBA password is mas******, or if at any point the SYSDBA password is being changed and the original password is entered, there is a prompt to select a different password.</p>
            <p>For user logins, the user login name and the user password can no longer be the same. After EUA enabling the database, if a password is created that matches the user login name, there is a prompt to select a different password. </p>
            <p class="p_3"><b>Important Note about SYSDBA Password for EUA Enabled Databases</b>
            </p>
            <p>It is <span class="span_4">extremely important</span><span class="span_4">that you archive the SYSDBA password to a removable storage drive as a source of password recovery. If the SYSDBA password is forgotten and was not archived, the password cannot be recovered.</span> &#160;To archive, when changing the SYSDBA password:</p>
            <p>When updating the SYSDBA password in the User Profile a message is now prompted, "Do you wish to create a Password Recovery File?" </p>
            <p>1. When selecting <span class="span_1">Yes</span><span class="span_1">,</span> a popup screen is displayed to create a password recovery disk that reads “Please insert your password recovery drive/disk and select the appropriate drive letter to archive the password. </p>
            <p>2. To refresh the drive list, click the drop down arrow. Then press OK to continue or Cancel to stop the process.” Click the arrow and select the drive to save the password to and click OK. </p>
            <p>3. Once the password is on the drive the prompt, “Password successfully archived” is displayed. </p>
            <p>4. Should the need arise to recover the password from the removable device, in the login screen click the Forgot Password link (which is only visible with the SYSDBA Login) then Insert the removable device and navigate to the removable device drive. </p>
            <p>5. Once logged in, the new SYSDBA password should be changed and re-archived to the removable disk.</p>
            <p>Should the need arise to recover the password from the removable device, in the login screen click the Forgot Password link (which is only visible with the SYSDBA Login) then Insert the removable device and navigate the removable device drive.&#160; Once logged in, the SYSDBA password should be changed and re-archived.</p>
