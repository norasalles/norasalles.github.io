            <h1><a name="Understanding_Your_Database_with_Reports" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor236"></a>Understanding Your Database with Reports</h1>
            <p><span class="span_2">This chapter addresses the use of </span><span class="span_2">ClientBase Reports. The key to quality reporting is having quality data in your system. The old adage “garbage in, garbage out” rings true. Many agencies miss out on marketing and reporting opportunities because they fail to recognize the importance of taking the time to capture important client data. Quality reporting, then, depends on the extent to which you capture data and the quality of the data captured. </span>
            </p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..7" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Computer systems can only report on the data entered into the system. We suggest entering every bit of information every time you receive new data, thus keeping your information as accurate and up-to-date as possible. Once data exists, you need a way to view the data in a meaningful way. The reports menu in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> provides a tool to evaluate whether the collected data is meaningful in helping to achieve the following three major goals:</p>
            <p>1) <span>Marketing</span> - By providing a bird’s eye view of the agency’s data, better understand the make-up of your customer database to more effectively plan marketing strategy and campaigns. </p>
            <p>2) <span>Quality Control</span> - By analyzing the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> data, easily detect the information that is being collected or that which is being missed, and whether the collected data is being correctly entered.</p>
            <p>3) <span>Training and Incentives</span> - By reviewing the quantity and quality of information entered by agents, train agents to further enhance agency goals, and use the results of reports to measure agents’ progress.</p>
            <p>If you are using <span class="span_2">Trams</span> products, such as <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> (TBO) or <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> by <span class="span_2">Trams</span> (CBT), you know that in these programs, you first enter the Report’s Menu or the Report’s Manager to setup the selection criteria before running the desired report. In <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, you have a choice of either running a Query containing the profiles, activities, or Res Cards you want included <span>before</span> selecting the desired report, or selecting the report you want to run first, and then choosing the profiles, activities, or Res Cards to include. </p>
            <h2><a name="Using_CLientBase_Query_Results_to_Run_Reports" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor237"></a>Using CLientBase Query Results to Run Reports</h2>
            <p>There are two ways of using the Query results to run reports in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Method One:</span> After completing a Query using Level 1, 2 or 3 filters in the Profile, Activity or Res Card Managers, the Results Screen provides a count and list of Query results matching the filters. These are the Query results that will be included in your report. Review those results before entering the Reports Menu. Select specific entries from the Query for the report, by holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key and, with your mouse, select consecutive or non-consecutive entries to narrow down results before clicking the Reports Menu. Only those selected entries are included in the reports. For additional selection choices, right mouse click in the results screen while holding down CTRL (if you have selected entries) to <span class="span_2">Invert All, Select All, or Unselect All. </span></p>
            <p>Remember to save any Query together with desired output columns, as outlined in the “Using” chapters in this manual. This saves time and effort the next time you run a report.</p>
            <p><span>Method Two:</span> Before performing your Query, click <span>Reports</span> in the Main Menu, then select from the sub-menus for Profile, Activity or Res Card Reports. After choosing the desired report, a dialog box appears:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 20 understanding your database with reports/understanding your database.jpg" style="height: 206px;width: 305px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Understanding%20Your%20Database%20with%20Reports.39.1.1.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>From here, include records from current results in the Profile, Activity or Res Card Manager, Selected Results in the Profile, Activity or Res Card Manager, or Re-Query the Profile, Activity or Res Manager. If you have not previously queried the records to include, you can do that now. </p>
            <p>Profile reports only use results from the Profile Manager; Activity Reports only use results from the Activity Manager; and Res Card Reports only use results from the Res Card Manager.</p>
            <p><span>Special Note: </span>Any report run in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> can be e-mailed as a .pdf (Adobe) file attachment by clicking the <span class="span_2">E-mail </span>icon on the report toolbar, or saved on your computer in .pdf format by clicking on the disk icon. </p>

            <p><span>Note: </span>In ClientBase v.3.08 or above, reports that use Traveler data have been changed to accommodate the traveler records.</p>

This report is very useful when projecting what vendor payments are due and when.

Unlike the <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> vendor activity reports, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> gives your agency the ability to run "Activity" reports based on criteria other than invoice issue date. Analyze sales figures based on booking date or other Res Card criteria. If the <span class="span_2">Include Itemization Details</span> setting is checked, upon running these reports, rather than just printing each reservation total, base, tax and commission, the system prints the itemization details if they have been captured for that reservation. </p>

            <h3><a name="Close_Ratio_Report" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor256"></a>Close Ratio Report</h3>
            <p>The Close Ratio Report analyzes the Res Cards within the current Res Card Manager Query results and provides statistics on your close ratio, which is the % of total Res Cards that include a confirmed or invoiced reservation. The report can be sorted by Agent or by Marketing Source, and the basis for considering a Res Card "closed" can be set to either having a "confirmed reservation" or an "invoiced reservation". The following information is then printed on this report: <span class="span_2">Agent Name or Marketing Source (based on report setting), Total Number of Res Cards, Total Number of Res Cards either with Invoices or with confirmed Reservations (based on report sorting), Total Number of Res Cards without Invoices or confirmed Reservations, Close Ratio Percentage, Average # of Days to Close, Average Trip Total, and Average Trip Commission.</span> </p>
            <p>If agents are trained to create a Res Card when a trip inquiry is first received, whether anything is booked at that time or not, then this report provides valuable sales analysis to help you track, train, and motivate your agents to close more of the inquiries that come into your agency. </p>
            <p>The setting <span class="span_2">Include only Users that have Stats</span> is checked by default and will include only users that have something other than 0 within the Profiles Created and Profiles Modified counts. If you would like to include a complete listing including Users that have no stats then remove the check within this setting.</p>
