            <h3><a name="Headers_and_Footers" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor140"></a>Headers and Footers</h3>
            <p>To print agency letterhead automatically for invoices, trip proposals, itineraries, trip statements, document templates, reports, and receipts, go to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|Header and Footer</span>. Agencies with multiple branches have the option of setting up just one global header/footer and use the branch merge fields for customization by branch. </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Note: </span>Settings at the branch level override the global level, if headers/footers have been setup areas in both locations. Likewise header/footer settings in the actual document template override the global level, if headers/footers have been setup in both locations.) Click <span class="span_2">Invoice, Trip Proposal, Itinerary, Trip Statements, Document Templates, Reports, </span>or <span class="span_2">Receipts</span> to setup Headers/Footers:</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Note: </span>Need to have individual logos for separate branches? See section below, <span class="span_2">How to Set Up User Level Logos in Headers/Footers</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Report Header/Report Footer/Page Header/Page Footer Tabs: </span>Click the desired tab to setup the headers and footers. The report header is the header on the first page of the report, the report footer is the footer on the last page in the report. The page header is for each page of the report, and the page footer is for each page of the report. If you have a Report Header/Footer and Page Header/Footer all setup, each prints on each of the pages you designate.</p>

            <p><span>Add Text</span>: Use <span class="span_2">Add Text</span> to insert text into the header or footer. A text box appears in the upper left corner. To type and format text, double-click the text box. A screen appears to enter your desired text, align the text, add merge fields (see below), and set the font. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to go back to the main screen. </p>
            <p><span>Add Picture</span>: Use <span class="span_2">Add Picture File</span> to insert a graphic file. Use the browse feature to locate the graphic file on any drive/directory and click <span class="span_2">Open</span> once located. (Use *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.bmp, *.ico, and *.emf type graphic files within headers and footers.) Double-click the graphic to access dialog box to set size and page alignment, or highlight the graphic to click and drag, size, and position it properly. </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Note: </span>To specify a size for your logo, double-click on the logo (do not try to resize in the header or footer area as this may distort image):</p>

            <p>Use the <span class="span_2">Add Text</span> or <span class="span_2">Add RTF</span> button to create any text box.

            <p>Logos can be added to Headers and Footers at the user level for use on Invoices, Itineraries, Trip Proposals, Trip Statements and Receipts. Some agencies have the need for an agent to have his or her own unique branding to appear on Invoice, Statements, etc. (such as agents who are Independent Contractors). To use the agent logo feature, it is necessary to add the agent's logo to the Agent's profile and to add the <span class="span_2">Primary Agent Logo</span> merge field to Headers and Footers.</p>
            <p>The agent's user login must be associated with an agent profile. Verify that the Agent Profile field is completed in the user login settings. If Agent Profile is missing from the user login, the SYSDBA user must login and complete it. (<span>Utilities|Setup|User Logins|User List.</span>) </p>
            <p>Next, query and select the agent profile, click the Attachments tab and <span class="span_2">Add</span>. There are two Attachment Types of Logo and General (for attachments other than logos). </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 set up clientbase for your agency1/how to set up user level logos_330x244.jpg" style="width: 330;height: 244;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Setting%20Up%20CB%20For%20Your%20Agency.04.1.04.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Select Logo, then Browse for Attachment and select the agent's logo image. Agent's logo image must be a *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.bmp, *.ico, or *.emf type graphic file. Make sure it's the correct size before you import it. Complete the Description field and click OK to save.</p>
            <p>After saving the agent logo, select the desired Header and Footer (Invoice, Trip Proposal, Receipt, etc.). Double-click on the global logo image to open the Picture Designer. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Do not change the current logo image. Click the down arrow on the <span class="span_2">Merge Field</span>, select Primary Agent Logo from the drop down and click OK to save. Repeat these steps to add the Primary Agent Logo merge field to each Header and Footer (Invoice, Trip Proposal, Receipt, etc.).</p>
            <p>If a logo exists in the Agent Profile, that logo is merged on to the document <span>as long as the Primary Agent Logo merge field</span> is entered in the Header and Footer. If no logo exists in the Agent Profile, or if the agent's user login does not have an assigned Agent Profile, the agency's usual Header and Footer is used (Branch level or the Global level).</p>

            <p>Database administrators can designate certain fields within a Profile, Activity or Res Card record as a mandatory field that must be completed for the record to be saved. By default, no fields in a Profile, Activity or Res Card are set as mandatory, but by going into and selecting the record type, set any field as either <span class="span_2">Required</span>, which means you cannot save the record without completing this field; or as <span class="span_2">Optional</span> which creates a reminder prompt when saving the record. If this field is left blank, the system still saves the record. </p>
            <p>Required fields for Profiles include <span class="span_2">General, Travelers, Marketing </span>and <span class="span_2">More Fields</span>. Required fields for Activities include <span class="span_2">Reminder/Note/Mailer</span><span class="span_2">Type, Subject, </span>and <span class="span_2">Remarks</span>. Required fields for Res Cards include <span class="span_2">More Fields, Reservation Level Fields, </span>and<span class="span_2"> Service Provider Fields</span>.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p style="font-style: italic;"><span>Note: </span>When a profile is set to <span class="span_2">Inactive, </span>required fields are disabled.</p>
                <p><span>Note: </span>There is a Communications tab in the Required Fields for Profile menu for all Profile types, because Primary Communication entries can now be located at either the Profile or the Traveler levels. If Required or Optional for any communication entry is enabled, when creating a new profile or editing an existing profile, ClientBase looks first for a communication entry that is marked as the profile's Primary. If none is found, it checks for the Primary Traveler's Primary Communication entry. If the required/optional entry is completed at one of the two levels, the requirement is met.</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic;"><span>Tip: </span>When agents are first learning to use <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, it is <span>not</span> a good idea to set too many fields as <span class="span_2">Required</span>, as this may discourage them from using the program. </p>

            <p>This feature, when enabled, uses the <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> client profile field,<span class="span_2"> Credit Limit,</span> along with the client account balance to determine if a client has exceeded their Credit Limit and if so warns your front line agents accordingly and disables the ability to generate further invoices without a form of payment.</p>
            <p>Disabled by default, <span class="span_2">Credit Limit Prompting </span>can be enabled by going to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|Credit Limit Prompting </span>and placing a check within <span class="span_2">Enable checking and prompting when Credit Limit is Exceeded</span>.</p>
            <h4><a name="How_this_feature_works_when_enabled" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>How this feature works when enabled</h4>
            <p>Upon opening a client profile that has exceeded its credit limit (account balance is greater than the credit limit entry in the <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> client profile), a warning appears notifying the User. This warning also appears when a Res Card is created or when Merge to PNR is selected for a client exceeding their credit limit. </p>
            <p>The client Quick View screen has also been updated to include Credit Limit information if the client has a Credit Limit captured within its <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> profile. The Quick View screen includes the client's Credit Limit, Account Balance and Available Credit.</p>
            <p>If a client has exceeded its credit limit, upon generating an invoice with no payment the system prompts <span class="span_2">This account has exceeded its credit limit. OK</span> and does not allow the user to generate the invoice unless their advanced user permission settings (described below) allow for overriding this message.</p>

Checking or not checking the <span class="span_2">Allow Free Flow</span> boxes either forces users to pull a group name from a default drop-down list, or allow users to free flow a group name into Client, Vendor, Agent and Other profile groups, as well as Invoice, Payment, Res Card, and Inventory groups. </p>
            <p>Allow Free Flow for <span class="span_2">Invoices/Payments/Res Card/Inventory</span> appear as one entry. If Allow Free Flow is checked for any one of the four it automatically checks all of them. </p>

            <p>User-Definable fields within <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> are easily identifiable by the blue underlined label next to the field. Clicking the blue label brings up a table to add, modify or delete customized lists. This drop-down customized list can also be globally added, modified and deleted from the<span> Global Defaults|General Setup|User-Defined Fields.</span></p>

            </p>
            <p>Many defaults have been set up for your use. If you do not want agents to free flow data into these fields, uncheck the <span class="span_2">Allow Free Flow</span> box. </p>
            <p>The following User- Defined drop-down fields dynamically expand to the width of the longest entry:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><span class="span_2">General Info: </span>Branch</p>
                <p><span class="span_2">General Info: </span>Special Dates<span class="span_2"> Type</span></p>

            <p>This makes it easier to select items from your drop-down lists that exceed the length of the field as it is displayed by allowing you to see the full entry without cutting it off.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;"><span>Hint: </span>A good way to modify user-defined fields, is just to start using the program with your own user login (granted with full access), and as you see a user-defined field item that needs to be added, modified, or delete, double-click the blue label to do these "on the fly". Also be careful not to give this permission to everyone or to allow <span class="span_2">free flow</span>, as you may start finding misspellings, duplicates, and inconsistencies that make the drop-downs unmanageable.</p>

These documents are quickly produced by using document templates. There are some default document templates that you need to customize before you use them. To help you setup global templates in your agency, a template editor is included under <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|Document Templates</span>.

            <p>Once the template has been loaded, make your changes to both the text and the merge fields. There are some word processing features included for your use. Merge fields are the fields in the document surrounded by chevrons, such as &lt;&lt;ProfSalutation&gt;&gt;. When the document template is selected from within a profile or from the results of a profile Query, this merge field is replaced with the entry included in the salutation field of the profile. Click <span class="span_2">Insert Fields </span>to pick from a list of merge fields. </p>

            <p>To remove merge fields, highlight them and press the <span class="span_2">Delete </span>key on the keyboard. To insert new merge fields, place your cursor in the desired location and click <span class="span_2">Insert Field</span>. A list of the various profile fields available for selection is displayed. Click the field to insert into your template. The merge fields <span class="span_2">Salutation|First Name</span> and <span class="span_2">Salutation|Courtesy Title Last Name</span> use the profile's salutation field within a document template and if blank, then uses either the <span class="span_2">First Name</span> or the <span class="span_2">Courtesy Title Last Name</span> instead.</p>
            <p><span>Tip: </span>If you select <span>Salutation|Courtesy Title Last Name</span> or <span>Salutation|First Name</span>, or <span>Salutation|Name</span> as a merge field, the | character included in the Salutation means that if the Salutation field is not completed within one of the resulting profiles, then for just that profile, you want it to use the merge field following the |.</p>
            <p><span>Margin Modification:</span> To modify page settings in the document template, click <span>File|Page Setup</span> to select paper size, orientation, and customize margins:</p>
            <p>Once all changes are complete, click <span>File|Save</span>. If you want to save the changes made to the template in a new template (so the old template remains unchanged), click <span>File|Save As</span> and assign your template a unique name. Close the existing template by clicking <span>File|Close</span> and load the next template to be modified.</p>

When completed, click <span class="span_2">File|Save As</span> and name the template. All templates are automatically stored in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> so a path to the file name is not necessary, just the filename. Each template’s name is limited to 40 characters and should easily identify the type of letter.</p>

            <h4><a name="Working_with_Template_Headers_Footers" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Working with Template Headers/Footers</h4>
            <p>The global header/footer provides the ability to include common information such as agency or branch address and phone information in document templates - without having to re-create the information for every template. It accomplishes this by the use of Merge Fields. There is one default global header and footer. Every template can either use the global header and/or footer<span class="span_2">; </span>or use its own unique header/footer loaded into the document template. A global template header/footer is created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> by going to <span>Global Defaults|Header and Footer|Document Templates </span>(see directions on creation above); and is loaded into the document template by default if you have check off the boxes, <span class="span_2">Include Header </span>or <span class="span_2">Include </span><span class="span_2">Footer</span>. A unique header and footer can be created for a document template, by clicking <span class="span_2">Header/Footer </span>and inserting a logo, graphic, text and merge fields into the header or footer areas as outlined above.</p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>To conserve disk space, we strongly recommend that any graphic files inserted into the global header are under 300 kb. When document templates are launched from the results of a profile Query, one document is created for each result. Therefore, if you run a Query that includes several hundred results, several hundred documents are created. If each document includes a large graphic file within the header, disk space may become an issue. </p>

Right-click on a misspelled word and you will be offered suggested spellings along with the ability to <span class="span_2">Ignore, Ignore All </span>or<span class="span_2"> Add</span> to Dictionary. In addition a Spell Check button, labeled <span class="span_2">ABC</span> has been added to the toolbar of the document templates allowing you to run the spell check routine across all data captured.</p>

            <p>Use the label setup area to customize envelopes.  To print envelopes vertically from your printer, modify the Avery 4150 (1 Across CoStar) driver defaults to create a unique envelope setting by inserting the measurements of your envelope, and "Save As" <span class="span_2">Envelope</span>. This Avery 4150 setting accommodates vertical printing. There are no vertical or horizonal gaps in an envelope setting, so set these to 0.00, and you need to measure in inches where you want printing to start from the left and from the top and put these measurements in <span class="span_2">Left Spacing </span>and <span class="span_2">Top Space.</span> Hold the envelope vertically. In the <span class="span_2">Label Properties </span>tab, insert the envelope’s width and length in inches and select <span class="span_2">Rectangle </span>from <span class="span_2">Label Shape</span> drop-down menu.</p>
            <p>If you print envelopes horizonally, create a unique envelope setting by selecting any horizonal label default, measuring the dimensions of your envelope (which acts as one big label), inserting these measurements as directed above, and “Save As” <span class="span_2">Envelope</span>. </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;text-indent: 0.5in;"><span>Note: </span>The Avery 4150 (1 Across CoStar) is a small label printer you can purchase at any office supply store. You may want to include this printer on your network as it prints single labels vertically and helps you avoid common pitfalls which may occur when using full label sheets. </p>

            <p>The Marketing Tables in a profile are used to identify each of your customer’s unique travel preferences, interests and demographics, while at the same time, automatically grouping clients with common codes. Since qualifying a customer for a leisure vacation can be the most difficult part of selling leisure travel, access to this valuable information might just make the difference between closing a sale or losing it. </p>
            <p>These marketing tables make it possible to consistently put the right product in front of the right client, by both your front-line agents and marketing programs geared towards generating travel interest. In addition, labels, letters and e-mails can be quickly created to link clients and travel preferences when a “hot” travel special lands on your desk. With a simple mouse click, every agent selects from the same list, and that means continuity among your clients and simplicity for your agents. </p>
            <p>All customer profiles have a tab called <span class="span_2">Marketing</span> which contain marketing tables. Some of these tables come with pre-defined default codes, but all of them can be customized to meet agency needs. There is no limit to the number of marketing tables that an agency can have; however, it is important to remember that for reporting purposes, it may become very difficult to see the true client traveling preferences if too many categories exist. For example, if you have both <span class="span_2">ancient sites</span> and <span class="span_2">archeological digs</span> as marketing categories, you might miss several clients who would be interested in a tour to an archeological dig if the report only includes clients from the <span class="span_2">archeological sites </span>marketing category<span class="span_2">.</span></p>
            <p>If you are a member of an agency consortium that has provided its own default market categories and codes within <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, check with the consortium before making any changes to the defaults (or add your own tables and codes directly below the defaulted tables).</p>

            <p>**If the number entered into the phone field does not start with a country code, but does start with an Area Code, the area code lands in the area code section, remaining digits land into entry field and the User or Global communication default populates the Country Code.

            <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> has added the ability to format Res Card invoice data within a PNR Rule so that agencies <span>NOT</span> using <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> (TBO) can print invoices from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, then send the invoice data to a PNR in the form of accounting lines that can be interfaced to a back office accounting system (see <span class="span_2">An In-depth Look at Res Cards</span> for complete steps). However, customize the <span class="span_2">Invoice Travel Types</span> to correspond to those in your accounting system. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> comes with 25 default Travel Types. <span>Note:</span> For agencies using <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>, you won’t be seeing Travel Types as these are edited in TBO, rather than <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> as links to General Ledger accounts exist.</p>
            <p>To edit those defaults:</p>

            </p>
            <p>1) Go to <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|Travel Types</span>. Here, you can modify each of the default types. </p>
            <p>2) Select the travel type edit and click <span class="span_2">Modify. </span>Travel types are user-defined and used upon invoicing to designate the type of travel the invoice is being generated for. Travel type is a merge field available for use when setting up your PNR Rules.</p>
            <p>3) Type the name of the new travel type.</p>
            <p>4) Under travel category from the drop-down menu, link this travel type to the appropriate travel category. Travel categories are pre-defined (<span class="span_2">Air, Hotel, Car, Cruise, Tour, Rail, Transportation, Insurance, Service Fee &amp; Other)</span> and used to categorize each reservation captured in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
            <p>5) Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>.</p>

            <p>This menu option gives you the ability to disable as well as clear the Credit Card field called <span class="span_2">Security Code</span> located within the Profile Cards tab. Recent credit card policies strongly discourage businesses from storing a credit card security code within any kind of database. As a result of this policy, we have defaulted this setting to disabled upon installing this update. Although discouraged, if you would like to re-enable this field, then go to <span>Global Defaults|Profile Defaults|Credit Card Settings</span> and place a check next to <span class="span_2">Enabled</span>. To clear all existing Security Code field entries from all existing Credit Card records within your database, click <span class="span_2">Clear All Credit Card Security Codes</span>. Running this process permanently removes all credit card security codes from your database.</p>

N uses a character from the name field, F uses a character from the first name field, L uses a character from the last name field, and a digit uses that position from the residential phone field (0 signifies the 10th digit of the phone number). Select a sample mask from the drop-down menu or create any mask that you desire. We recommend using the Interface ID mask of NNN4567890 which uses the first 3 letters of the client's last name, and the last 7 digits of the client's phone number.

            <p>Within this area a listing of the following profile fields is available for automatic case handling: <span class="span_2">Company Name, First Name, Last Name, Courtesy Title, Address 1, Address 2, Apt/Suite, City, Country, Traveler First Name, Traveler Last Name, Traveler Courtesy Title, </span>and<span class="span_2"> Traveler Relationship/Title. </span></p>
            <p>By placing a check into any of these fields, as you are working within <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profiles, the first letter of each word entered is automatically capitalized and the remaining letters are automatically set to lower case. </p>
            <p>To <span>override</span> the system's automatic case handling for entries such as McLeod or NE (where the auto case handling reverts to Mcleod and Ne), tab past the field then move back into it (by using &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;), as the automatic case handling is turned off for a field once entries exist within it. Another option is to enter McLeod as Mc Leod and NE as N.E., since spaces and punctuation allow for capitalization.</p>
            <p><span>Tip: </span>If you have many profiles that have already been created by solid caps or all lower case letters, use the <span class="span_2">Case Converter</span> in Utilities to convert <span class="span_4">these first before setting this up.</span></p>

All three or any combination of these settings may be selected; therefore, check the box or boxes of the currencies that should appear for pricing on an invoice. These settings are only used when Track Res Card Balances is set to Agency Currency.</p>

            <p><span>Example:</span> An agency located in Canada booked a cruise with a US vendor. In the Multiple Currency screen the Vendor currency was entered as $1500 US dollars. The Agency Currency was entered as $1400 Canadian dollars. If the <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency</span> option was checked, only the Canadian dollars appear under pricing when the invoice is generated. If both <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency</span> and <span class="span_2">Show Vendor Currency</span> options were checked, pricing appears in both Canadian dollars and US dollars. If the client paid for the reservation in a different currency (i.e. Euros) and that amount was entered as the Client Currency on the Multiple Currency screen and all three options where checked, pricing would appear in all three currencies.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">If agency chooses to track reservation totals in the foreign currency,</span> when tracking balances in Foreign currency there is no longer a Multi Currency screen. Each reservation is entered in the currency it was booked in by clicking the Currency drop-down and selecting the correct currency code. Once the currency code is chosen the currency rate is displayed. Currency rates are based on the Currency Setup in Global Defaults but can be changed at the time of booking if needed. However, if ARC/BSP is checked, the currency must remain in the agency's currency and the Currency field is disabled. </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;text-indent: 0.5in;"><b>NOTE:</b> When Commission GST rate is changed by the user, the Client GST rate is no longer also updated. Similarly, when the Client GST rate is changed by the user, Commission GST rate is no longer also updated. Place of supply rules for GST rates are still in effect when a reservation is created.</p>

            <p>Res Card More Fields are used for capturing any type of trip data that the Res Card currently is not prompting for, giving you the ultimate flexibility in tracking trip information. Res Card More Fields can be linked to a <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> UDID (User Defined Interface Data) field too, so upon invoicing in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, the more field entry automatically populates the appropriate TBO UDID field. When setting up the Res Card More Fields, you have the ability to link a Profile More Field to a Res Card More Field which means upon creating a new Res Card, the Res Card More Field automatically is completed with the entry in the profile more field. </p>
            <p>This means if certain client data is being captured in a profile more field and being merged into a PNR via the PNR rules for the purpose of completing a TBO UDID, you can invoice from <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and automatically complete that data into any new Res Cards, and upon invoicing complete the TBO UDID with no extra steps. </p>
            <p>Setup Res Card More Fields categories and items by following these steps:</p>
            <p>1) Go to More Field Categories to assign a field name by going to <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|More Field Categories</span>, and complete the following fields: </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 set up clientbase for your agency1/create payment reminders automatically_220x294.png" style="width: 220;height: 294;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p><span>Category Name: </span>Enter a descriptive name.</p>
            <p><span>Profile More Field Link: </span>Link this Res Card More Field to a Profile More Field for automatic completion when creating a new Res Card, by selecting profile more field from the drop-down menu. This field can be left blank, and only works if you currently have profile More Fields created.</p>
            <p><span>UDID No.: </span>To link a specific UDID (User Defined Interface Data) from <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> to a Res Card More Field so that upon invoicing, a Res Card the value in the Res Card More Field automatically populates the value in the TBO UDID, select from the drop-down menu. When the reservation is invoiced, the UDID fields in TBO are populated and appear on TBO invoices/reports, although they do not appear on invoices generated in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. This field can be left blank.</p>
            <p><span>Format Type</span>: Specify what characters are entered into the field. Format Type displays a drop selection of options which are: <span class="span_2">None (Res Card More Fields will continue to work as it does currently); Letters Only; Numbers Only; Letters and Numbers Only.</span></p>
            <p>A different format option can be selected for each Res Card More Field. A field length can also be set for a Res Card More Field by entering the number of characters allowed in the Max Length field. Maximum number of characters for a More Field is 80 characters. The new formatting options can only be used when adding new Res Card More Field categories. Existing Res Card More Field categories cannot be formatted.</p>
            <p>When a Res Card More field is formatted, when entering a value for the More Field, the value can only be entered using the format designated for that category. If an incorrect value is entered a message is displayed informing you of the proper format. So if the More Field was formatted to accept numbers only and an alpha character is entered into the field, the message would appear, <span class="span_2">Invalid Entry. Format Type is Numbers Only</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Inactive: </span>When a More Field is made inactive, it is not displayed on the More Fields tab of profiles or res cards, and will not print on invoices. Inactive More Fields are still available for use in Res Card and Profile queries, as well as Global Modify. If the More Field was set as <span class="span_2">Required</span> or <span class="span_2">Optional</span>, it will no longer be required or optional once made inactive. More Fields must be unlinked from UDIDs and/or other More Fields before being made inactive. </p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>The Format Options menu is read only for sync copies.</p>
            <p>2. Go to <span>User-Defined Fields|More Field Items|Res Card More Field Items</span> and use <span class="span_2">Add, Modify, </span>and <span class="span_2">Delete </span>to setup the drop-down list of defaults by completing the following fields:</p>
            <p><span>Category Name: </span>Select the desired Res Card More Field category name by selecting from the drop-down menu. This listing was created when you created the more field categories above.</p>
            <p><span>Item Value: </span>Type in the desired Item Value. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>.</p>
            <p>3. Repeat these steps for each Res Card More Field value that you would like to include for each Res Card More Field category. </p>
            <p>To learn how to use the Res Card More Fields, please refer to chapter, <span class="span_2">An In-Depth Look at Res Cards.</span></p>
            <p><a name="kanchor168"></a><span>Use of Res Card More Fields</span><span>:&#160; </span>When More Fields are created, the same More Fields can be used either at the Res Card Level or at the Reservation Level.&#160; When a More Field value is entered at the Res Card Level, that value carries over into each of the invoice bookings.&#160; A unique More Field value can be made for a specific reservation; however, by going into the More Field tab inside the reservation.</p>

            <p>To ensure that travel insurance protection is offered to every customer and either accepted or declined, setup <span class="span_2">Res Card Insurance Prompting</span>. If activated, this feature looks for any insurance reservations at the time of generating an invoice or itinerary. If none exists, the system prompts with a message: <span class="span_2">"No Insurance Reservations Exist for this trip. Accept or Decline Insurance." </span>Declining insurance then includes an agency-defined waiver message for printing at the bottom of the invoice or itinerary.</p>
            <p>Accepting insurance takes the agent to a new reservation, defaulting the travel category to insurance and the vendor to the agency defined default insurance vendor, for capturing an insurance booking.

            <p>Previous versions of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> used the <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> setting for <span class="span_2">Allow Cash Payment from Invoice</span> within the Global Defaults setting to determine whether a cash or check payment should be saved to the database and applied to the invoice to close the Client Balance. Now these settings are captured in <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Default Field Values for New Invoices</span> option. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 set up clientbase for your agency1/create payment reminders automatically_6.jpg" style="height: 402px;width: 570px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Setting%20Up%20CB%20For%20Your%20Agency2.05.1.08.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p><span>Payment Defaults: </span>By selecting a form of payment from the drop-down this <span>Form of Payment </span>is the default displayed upon invoicing. You can also default a <span>Trip Balance Due Date </span>upon invoicing, by selecting <span class="span_2">Earliest Reservation Final Payment Due Date</span> from the drop-down. This setting is very often filled in upon completion of a Live Connect reservation, or you can manually enter this into a reservation yourself by going to the <span class="span_2">Payment Due Date </span>reservation tab.</p>
            <p>A separate setting can be designated for each form of payment: <span class="span_2">Cash, Check, Credit Card and CC Merchant</span>. Adding a check to the form of payment indicates that upon invoicing with that form of payment, the payment is automatically saved and applied to the invoice. Removing the check from the form of payment indicates that upon invoicing with that form of payment, the printed version of the invoice shows as paid, but the payment does not get saved to the database leaving the invoice and Client Balance open.</p>
            <p><span>Tip for Non-</span><span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span><span> Users: </span>By leaving all these forms of payments unchecked, you have ease when voiding out invoices that are incorrect since this area is designed for use with <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>.</p>
            <p>Check <span>Disable Editing Invoice Issue Date</span> if you want the Invoice Issue Date to remain unchanged. There is also a setting for <span>Save ALL Invoices to Branch X</span> which allows an agency to setup multiple branches with different headers/footers, default remarks and format settings within <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> but still save all invoices to a single branch in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>. This setting works well for agencies with IC's that want different invoice defaults in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> but still need all accounting data to land in one branch.</p>
            <p><span>Auto Update TBO Car/Hotel Comm Track Bookings</span>: By checking this setting, upon saving changes to a Res Card, the program checks for changes made to any Car/Hotel Reservations that were invoiced as Comm Track (with only 1 invoice) and updates the booking in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> by voiding the booking and adding a new one with the updated information.</p>
            <p>Changing a reservation amount in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> when the invoice booking shows as paid in TBO updates the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> side only. If attempted the system gives the prompt, <span class="span_2">TBO Comm Track Booking cannot be updated. Booking was closed</span>; however, the reservation changes can still be saved in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Changing a Reservation in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to <span class="span_2">Cancelled</span> will void the booking in TBO without recreating a new booking.</p>
            <p><span>Form of Payment</span>: Set to default to either <span class="span_2">Cash, Check, Credit Card, CC Merchant or No Default</span>. If the default <span class="span_2">Form of Payment</span> is set to Credit Card or CC Merchant, the system automatically defaults the credit card number to the first credit card entry within the profile being invoiced.</p>
            <p><span>Trip Balance Due Date</span>: Set to default to either the <span class="span_2">Earliest Reservation Final Payment Due Date</span>, or leave blank for no default.</p>
            <p><span>Travel Category Defaults:</span> Set a default <span class="span_2">Travel Type</span> for each reservation <span class="span_2">Travel Category</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Travel Type Defaults</span>: Set a default <span class="span_2">Submit To</span> setting for each <span class="span_2">Travel Type </span>as well as a default setting for <span class="span_2">Show as Paid when Invoiced as Comm Track</span>. (Use this for each travel type if you want a comm track amount paid by credit card to appear in invoice totals printed for the customer.) </p>

            </p>
            <p>Since many times an agent creates multiple reminders at one time after booking a reservation to help remember common tasks such as collecting deposit, final payment, checking for documents, sending welcome home letters, etc., you can create a global set of <span class="span_2">Batched Reminders</span> that can be launched from within a Res Card to create multiple reminders all at one time.</p>
            <p>Although you can add unlimited batches to this area, a default cruise/tour batch has been created for you which contains the reminders, <span class="span_2">Deposit Due, Final Payment Due, Validate Int’l Security Information, Send Gift, Check for Documents, </span>and <span class="span_2">Welcome Home. </span></p>
            <p>To create a batch reminder:</p>
            <p>1) Go to <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Batch Reminder Settings.</span> Click <span class="span_2">Add </span>to add an additional batch, <span class="span_2">Modify</span> to edit an existing batch, or <span class="span_2">Delete</span> to remove a batch.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 set up clientbase for your agency1/chapter 3 set up clientbase for your agency_2_2.jpg" style="height: 381px;width: 495px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Setting%20Up%20CB%20For%20Your%20Agency2.05.1.10.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>2) Fill out the <span class="span_2">Batch Reminder Name</span> and <span class="span_2">Description </span>(such as <span class="span_2">Cruise Booking Reminders</span>, or <span class="span_2">Default Reminders for a Cruise Reservation</span>)<span class="span_2">.</span></p>
            <p>3) A batch of reminders can include any number of reminders from 1 to 100. Click <span class="span_2">Add</span> to create the first reminder for the batch and complete the following fields:</p>
            <p><span>Create Reminder: </span>From the drop-down menu, select <span class="span_2">Optional </span>or<span class="span_2"> Always. </span>Upon launching batch reminders from a Res Card, a listing of default reminders appears. An <span class="span_2">Optional </span>entry prompts you to "check off" the reminder before placing it into a Res Card; the <span class="span_2">Always</span> entry is already "checked off" for you. </p>
            <p><span>Default Date Using:</span> From the drop-down menu, select <span class="span_2">Current Date, ResCard Create Date, Trip Start Date, </span>or <span class="span_2">Trip Return Date. </span>(These date entries are merge fields used when launching the batched reminders from a Res Card. This defaulted date can be overwritten at the time of launching the batched reminders just before creating and saving them to the Res Card activities tab.)</p>
            <p><span>Plus/minus|Number of Days:</span> From the drop-down menu, select the plus or minus sign and choose the number of days from 1 to 2000 to use in combination with the <span class="span_2">Default Date Using</span> field.</p>
            <p><span>To-Do:</span> Check here if you do not want to set a specific time for this reminder to appear on the Day-At A Glance feature. All timeless activities appear on a separate area in your calendar, but not under a specific time frame.</p>
            <p><span>Start Time:</span> Enter time you want alarm to start alerting you about this reminder; or if you want this reminder to appear on the Day-At A Glance on your calendar as an appointment under the time you specify.</p>
            <p><span>Duration:</span> Specify a block of time for this task to appear on your calendar.</p>
            <p><span>Login Name: </span>Defaults to the user logged into the system. Choose a different user by clicking the drop-down menu.</p>
            <p><span>Priority:</span> Click the drop-down menu to tag this reminder with a priority level - high, medium, or low. The priority level can be used as search criteria in both Level 2 Query of the Activity Manager and viewed in selected activity reports. </p>
            <p><span>Private:</span> Check this box to make reminder private. Only the sign-in agent and SYSDBA can access the reminder.</p>
            <p><span>Reminder Type:</span> Enter the type of follow-up for the reminder by clicking the drop-down menu and picking from a customized list. Such types may include phone call, e-mail, letter, etc. Reminder types are user-defined and setup in <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Reminder Type</span> or clicking on the blue underlined label.</p>
            <p><span>Subject:</span> Enter the subject of the reminder by clicking the drop-down menu and picking from a user-defined list. Subjects are setup in <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|User Defined Fields|Reminder Subject</span>, or by clicking on the blue underlined label.</p>
            <p><span>Set Alarm: </span>To further assist with remembering important tasks, <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> reminders include an optional alarm. Like the alarm which awakens you each morning, the alarm activates at the time designated within the reminder (regardless of where you are in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, or any other program) as long as <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> is running on your PC. When an alarm is activated, a window appears that includes the details of the reminder along with three options: </p>
            <p><span>1) </span><span class="span_5">Off:</span> Turns off the alarm but keeps the reminder open and on to-do list.</p>
            <p><span>2) </span><span class="span_5">Snooze:</span> Reschedules the alarm for a future time.</p>
            <p><span>3)</span><span class="span_5">View</span><span class="span_4">:</span> Allows you to work the reminder.</p>
            <p><span>Tip:</span> It is suggested you do not set alarms for the agents’ batched reminders. Let each agent set these up for themselves when they launch the batch reminders in the Res Card. This saves them from being barraged with numerous alarms for each Res Card in which they have created reminders.</p>
            <p><span>Completed:</span> This field is empty until the reminder is completed and a date is entered. Entering a <span class="span_2">Complete Date</span> takes this reminder off the to-do list.</p>
            <p><span>Remarks:</span> Enter any additional remarks or instructions in the text box at the bottom of the reminder entry screen.</p>
            <p>4) Continue entering additional reminders for this batch. After each default reminder is created for this batch, click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to save the batch. Create more than one batch if desired. For directions on how to use batch reminders, please refer to the chapter, <span class="span_2">An In-Depth Look at Res Cards.</span></p>

            <p>Merge PNR Settings for Traveler Name Formats also includes the ability to create custom format settings for Children (over 2) and Infants (under 2). Use a combination of text, merge fields and special characters to format travelers as either children or infants based on the traveler level Birthdate entry. The following Merge Fields can be included in this rule: <span class="span_2">Courtesy Title, First Name, Last Name, Middle Initial, Middle Name, No. of Travelers, First Name Initial, 2 Digit Age In Months, 2 Digit Age in Years, Birthdate (various date formats)</span>.</p>

            <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> comes with default entries for all the main PNR entries for each GDS. There is no limit to the information that can be entered into a PNR as long as it is formatted correctly for your GDS.

Click the arrow located to the right of this field to select from a drop-down list of choices. Each field group includes a designated list of profile fields available for use within a PNR rule.

For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this <span class="span_2">Display on Selection Screen</span> can be unchecked so that the first selection screen is less complicated for the agent to review.

            <p>When setting up rules, you may choose to include merge fields that aren’t always completed in every profile. Such fields include <span class="span_2">Courtesy Title, Apt/Suite, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Company Name</span>. If the field is completed, you want it included; but if it’s not, you don’t want to include the formatting with a blank space. To handle this, the PNR rules uses left and right brackets <span>[ ]</span> to surround a set of characters within a rule, and designate that if the merge field within those brackets is blank, then don’t include any of the characters between the brackets. Here’s an example:</p>
            <p>The brackets around <span>[5/&lt;&lt;CompanyName&gt;&gt;§]</span> suggest that if this is an leisure profile so the <span class="span_2">Company Name Merge Field</span> is blank, then don’t include the 5/ or end item formatting either.</p>

            <p>Upon installation of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, by default all queries are automatically enabled in each of four managers (Profile, Activity, Res Card, and Inventory), as well as in the Profile Travel History tab, Profile Payment History tab, and on the Profile Indicator buttons. If your database contains more than 25,000 profiles; however, you may want to consider disabling this automatic Query option for optimum performance. To do this globally, go to <span>Global Defaults|Settings|Automatic Query Settings</span> and select <span class="span_2">Disable</span> from the drop-down menu for any of the queries that you do not want to run automatically.</p>

            <p><span>Special Note to Remote Users:</span> Also, if you are a user connecting to the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database remotely, you need to disable the automatic Query option. This can be done at the workstation level, by going to <span>Workstation Defaults|Environment|General Options and Profile Options.</span></p>

            <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> has a centralized database which means that all branches associated with the agency are included within one database. The program comes with an unlimited number of branch records and for reporting purposes, this feature makes it extremely convenient to analyze the database by branch entries. Each client and agent profile has a field where the branch number can be entered. This entry is not a mandatory field in the client and agent profile, but we do suggest it be linked to the agent profile if possible. </p>
            <p>

            <p><span>Copy/Paste: </span>For you convenience there is a <span class="span_2">Copy/Paste </span>option for Branches. This is quite a timesaver if you have setup one branch and don’t want to repeat this process for other branches. Highlight the branch entry to copy and click <span class="span_2">Copy. </span>When <span class="span_2">Paste </span>is selected, you can choose <span class="span_2">Paste Over Selected Branch, </span>or <span class="span_2">Paste as a New Branch.&#160; </span>All branch fields and settings are overwritten with the defaults from the branch copied, except for address, communication entries, Branch ID, Next Sales and Refund Invoice # in the general area. Nothing is saved until <span class="span_2">OK </span>is selected, so please review all areas of the branch settings before saving to ensure you have not lost any information that you may not have realized got overwritten with the <span class="span_2">Paste</span> feature.</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Trams</span> considers the 0 Branch as the main branch and 1, 2, 3, etc. as Branch 1, 2, 3. Click <span class="span_2">Modify</span> to enter the branch information from an existing blank branch.</p>

            <p>There are 1000 branches available for use. .Branches can be added and deleted. A branch cannot be deleted if there is a profile, res card, invoice or payment record assigned to it.  Branch numbers of deleted branches can be re-used. All newly added branches are added at the end of the list of branches, even if they are reusing a number from a deleted branch that used to be higher up.  The order of branches can now be changed using the up and down arrows on the right side of the screen. This sort order is shared by all Trams products. </p>
            <p>Branches can only be added, deleted, or re-ordered on the Primary copy of the database.</p>

            <h4><a name="Auto-Update_Feature" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Auto-Upd"></a><a name="kanchor191"></a>Auto-Update Feature</h4>
            <p><i>ClientBase</i> will automatically install updates when they become available. Auto-update greatly streamlines installing updates on users' workstations and ensures fixes are being installed in a timely manner. Auto-update will only install updates that match the current major version (4.09.01 or 4.08.02, for example).</p>
            <p>When <i>ClientBase</i> is launched, the auto-update feature checks to see if a newer version is available, then automatically downloads and installs the update on the users' workstation. The automatic update works for <i>tramswin</i>, <i>download</i>, <i>ibbackup</i> and the <i>ibbackuplib</i> files. The earlier versions of the executables will be renamed by appending <i>.old</i> to the file name during the process, so they are available to roll back to an earlier version, if necessary.</p>
            <p>Users can postpone the auto-update for 24 hours or 1 week; after which they will be prompted again that an update is available.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span class="span_3"><b>*Note</b>: </span>If a user does not have administrative rights, the auto-update routine won't be able to install the new versions. You can get around this by giving users Read &amp; Execute, List folder contents, Read, Write, Modify Security permissions to the Trams folder, subfolders and files in which <i>ClientBase</i> is installed (e.g., <i>C:\Program Files (x86)\Trams\</i>).</p>

            <p>Click <span class="span_2">General </span>in the directory on the left. Enter the branch information. All the fields in this screen are shared with <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office </span>except for <span class="span_2">Next Sales Invoice Number </span>and <span class="span_2">Refund Number</span>. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> can have its own separate sequence of invoice/refund numbers for use when generating invoices/refunds in the Res Card. If your agency starts generating invoices/refunds from the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Res Card, enter the starting invoice and refund number here and the system automatically assigns the next sequential invoice/refund number each time an invoice/refund is generated. Since <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office </span>does not allow duplicate invoice numbers, be sure to start a series of numbers not currently in use in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office </span>(the system allows up to 9 digits). </p>
            <p><span>Tip: </span>If you are a <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> user, start your <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> invoice/refund numbers with different numbers, so you can differentiate between invoices/refunds driven by your GDS, those created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, and if you have a separate series set up for manual invoices and refunds in TBO, those as well.</p>

These tables allow you to capture any PNR entries or remarks you would like included when sending data to a PNR. The branch level entries tab is where information can be included in a PNR regardless of the agent, client or traveler selected. Examples are the communication information for the branch or an appreciation message for the client’s business. </p>

The PNR selection screen appears when you use the Merge to PNR feature, and allows you to select the specific profile data to be included and sent to the current PNR. For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this Display on Selection Screen can be unchecked so that the selection screen is less complicated for the agent to review. </p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Default Invoice Setting:</span> Set the Res Card invoice default as <span class="span_2">Invoice Only</span> which is a shorter invoice format that does not included all itinerary level information; or <span class="span_2">Itin/Invoice</span> which is a longer invoice format that does include all the itinerary level information. </p>
            <p><span>Language: </span>Defaults to English but can be changed to French or Spanish. This branch level language default can be overwritten on an invoice-by-invoice basis by clicking the "Invoice Format" button on the Generate Invoice Screen. Please keep in mind that all field labels have been translated to French and Spanish, but the agent must capture the Reservation entries in the desired language in order to print in that language. Also, Invoice Header/Footer labels are defined by the agency and therefore cannot be translated. <span>Tip:</span> You may want to consider setting up a special Branch for "French|Spanish" Invoices and change the Header|Footer merge field labels to the desired language and hand select this branch's Header/Footer when generating invoices in French or Spanish.</p>
            <p><span>Include Summary of All Reservations:</span> Set the Res Card invoice default by checking if you want reservation details including balance due date to appear on the invoice. </p>
            <p><span>Preview Invoice Before Printing:</span> Set the Res Card invoice default by checking if you always want a preview invoice (highly recommended) to be printed before actually generating the invoice. </p>
            <p><span>Include Service Provider Graphics:</span> Set the Res Card invoice defaults by checking here if you want service provider graphics included when an invoice is printed. </p>
            <p><span>Hide Reservation Vendor Name:</span> Gives you greater flexibility in customizing the print out of an invoice. If this setting is checked, then the Vendor Name for each individual reservation within the Res Card being invoice will not be printed, only the Service Provider Names. </p>
            <p><span>Hide Reservation Totals (Include Only Invoice Totals):</span> Gives you greater flexibility in customizing the print out of an invoice. If this setting is checked, then each individual reservation amount will not be printed, only the sum of all reservations being invoiced. </p>
            <p><span>Print Service Fee as Invoice Total Line Item:</span> Gives you greater flexibility in customizing the print out Service Fees on an invoice. If checked, this setting adds any reservations with a Travel Category of Service Fee and prints them as a single total amount listed within the Invoice Totals just underneath Reservation Totals, rather than listing as a separate reservation within the body of the invoice. </p>
            <p><span>Service Fee Label</span>: This is a free-flow field that allows for up to 25 characters and provides you with the ability to customize how agency service fees are labeled on the invoice. </p>
            <p><span>Print Reservation in Condensed Format: </span>The following <span class="span_2">Print Reservation in Condensed Format </span>are broken down by Travel Category:</p>
            <p class="p_6">Print Air Reservation in Condensed Format</p>
            <p class="p_6">Print Hotel Reservation in Condensed Format</p>
            <p class="p_6">Print Car Reservation in Condensed Format</p>

            <p class="p_6">Print Rail Reservation in Condensed Format</p>
            <p class="p_6">Print Tour Reservation in Condensed Format</p>
            <p class="p_6">Print Transportation Reservation in Condensed Format</p>
            <p>If checked, upon invoicing a reservation for that Travel Category a summary of basic Reservation information is included, rather than a detailed listing of all Reservation and Service Provider level information. This setting may be desired for reservations that you would like to place less emphasis on when printing invoices for your client. For example, if you are invoicing a cruise vacation, you may choose to place a greater emphasis on the cruise reservation and less emphasis on the Insurance, Airport, Hotel, etc. </p>
            <p>Here is a listing of the reservation details included if <span class="span_2">Print Reservation in Condensed Format</span> is checked. All other Reservation and Service Provider level data is omitted from the printed version of the invoice.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="ListParagraph">Vendor Name, Traveler Name/s, Start Date, End Date</li>
                <li class="ListParagraph">If Supplier, ARC or Comm Track Show as Paid: Res Amount, This Invoice, Prior Invoice and Balance</li>
                <li class="ListParagraph">If Comm Track Not Show as Paid: Amount Details</li>

            </ul>
            <p><span>Multi-Currency:</span> All three or any combination of these settings may be selected; therefore, check the box or boxes of the currencies that should appear for pricing on an invoice. These settings are only used when Track Res Card Balances is set to Agency Currency.</p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> An agency located in Canada booked a cruise with a US vendor. In the Multiple Currency screen the Vendor currency was entered as $1500 US dollars. The Agency Currency was entered as $1400 Canadian dollars. If the <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency</span> option was checked, only the Canadian dollars will appear under pricing when the invoice is generated. If both <span class="span_2">Show Agency Currency</span> and <span class="span_2">Show Vendor Currency</span> options were checked, pricing will appear in both Canadian dollars and US dollars. If the client paid for the reservation in a different currency (i.e. Euros) and that amount was entered as the Client Currency on the Multiple Currency screen and all three options where checked, pricing would appear in all three currencies.</p>

            <p>Your database quickly becomes a valuable asset to your agency. The unique value of your database creates a need for security. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> allows you to control the access to the database for every user. The “front door” of the program is locked - only an assigned login name and password allows entry to the database. Once inside, the pre-set security options for the user name and password allow the owner or administrator to control what tasks the agent can or cannot perform.</p>
            <p>User logins are setup to define who has access to what areas in your database and to establish defaults that might be unique to each user. They are created when the owner or administrator is signed in as SYSDBA. Go to <span>Utilities|User Login|User List</span> to view the current list of user logins.</p>
            <p><span>Special Note:</span> Before setting up the user login permissions, it is suggested that you modify the <span class="span_2">Group Security Levels</span> by going to <span>Utilities|User Login|Group Security Levels </span>which acts as a <span>master</span> for some of the default settings. Follow the directions as listed below to do this. That way you’ll have less to edit when you want the same permissions for more than one user in this section. We have provided you with some suggested default "masters," but you can certainly modified the master or create new masters for your use.</p>
            <p>The only user login that provides access to the user list is the SYSDBA (System Database Administrator) login. When Client Base is initially installed, this SYSDBA login comes with the default password that is sent to you with your startup e-mail. It is highly recommended that the agency administrator change the password to one that only he/she knows, so others cannot modify the system. Remember, when you change it in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, you are also changing it for <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> users, as they share one database. <span>Caution: When you change the SYSDBA password, you no longer have a password as a "key" that </span><span class="span_2">Trams</span><span> support can help you with. DO NOT FORGET THIS PASSWORD when changed!</span><span><br /></span><br /><span class="Heading3Char">Users of Multiple P</span><span class="Heading3Char">roducts</span></p>

            <p>If they update the password of an existing user in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Windows, it will not update the password in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Online. This also works in the reverse. If they change a password in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Online and want to use the same password for that user in CBW, they will have to set it up again on the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Windows side.</p>

            <p><span>Modify:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Modify</span> to change the settings of an existing user login. The login name is dimmed. Depending on the user, modification may only be necessary if the agent, for example, has changed job responsibilities or has gone on vacation. When you have made the proper modifications, click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. </p>
            <p><span>Delete:</span> Click <span class="span_2">Delete</span> to remove a user from the login list. If you delete this profile in error, you have to re-enter the information again. If you prefer, you may check the <span class="span_2">Disable</span> area to deny access. </p>
            <p><span>Hint:</span> It is suggested that you only use the SYSDBA login to setup security, and that you create a unique login for other work that you do in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.

            </p>
            <p><span>Login name</span>: Name that is used to log into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. This should not include any spaces in the user name and should be fairly short in length. This field is NOT case sensitive. </p>
            <p><span>Note</span>: The <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> password and the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> password for the same user name are the same, REGARDLESS of whether or not it is in the same database. The password is located on the Interbase server computer and NOT in the database. </p>
            <p><span>User Password: </span>The password for this user only. This is an alphanumeric field, which means you can use a combination of numbers and letters. Choose a password that is easy for the user to remember, but not so simple as to allow someone else to login as this user. The password has a mask of *** so the password is hidden when typed. In this screen, regardless of the length of the password, the *** always shows 7 characters.</p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> If a User Password is reset via <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, the password is automatically reset in both <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> and <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Browser/CBO Sync users which includes a <span class="span_2">Forgot my Password</span> feature that will reset the User Password automatically. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Browser/CBO Sync users also now includes the ability to <span class="span_2">View Your Own Login</span> which includes the ability to modify your Login Password. If the User Login password is changed through CBO Sync via either of these methods, then the CBO Sync login password will remain different than the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> login password until the password is resaved within <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>
            <p><span>User Name: </span>User’s full name. This field, the <span class="span_2">User Title, </span>and the<span class="span_2"> E-mail </span>fields can be used in document templates.</p>
            <p><span>Title</span>: Job title of the new user.</p>
            <p><span>E-mail Address:</span> E-mail of the new user. </p>
            <p><span>Agent Profile</span>: Associates the user with a specific agent profile and stamps transactions with the agent’s information, thus, eliminating the need to manually add agent information each time. An audit trail of the agent’s activity is available as a result. Type in a few letters of the agent profile and choose from the drop-down. (Did you create an agent profile and link it to a branch? You must do this first.)</p>
            <p><span>Automatically Update E-mail Calendar for Uncompleted Reminders: </span>Enable the ability to update an E-mail calendar with Reminders created in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Select from the drop-down:</p>
            <p><span>Never: </span>Reminders are never sent to the e-mail calendar.</p>
            <p><span>All Reminders:</span> All Open Reminders are sent to the e-mail calendar.</p>
            <p><span>Only Reminders set for a Time </span>- Only Open Reminders with a selected Start Time are sent to the e-mail calendar.</p>
            <p><span>Only Reminders set with an Alarm</span> - Only Open Reminders with the Set Alarm Box checked are sent to the e-mail calendar</p>
            <p>The user's e-mail address is used for sending Reminders to the E-mail Calendar. If the user does not have an e-mail address entered in their User Settings, <span class="span_2">Never</span> is the only setting that can be entered for this field.</p>
            <p>When creating or editing reminders a new checkbox, <span class="span_2">Update E-mail Calendar after Saving Changes</span> was added. When checked, updates are sent to user's e-mail address. This box is checked by default when the setting from User Settings is <span class="span_2">All Reminders</span> or <span class="span_2">Only for Reminders when time is set</span>.</p>
            <p>Upon saving the Reminder, an e-mail is sent to the user. If the <span class="span_2">Default E-mail Client setting is Outlook/MAPI Client or MAPI Client</span>, the e-mail includes the e-mail appointment setup screen as an attachment. Open the attachment and click <span class="span_2">Save and Close</span> to save the Reminder to the e-mail calendar. If <span class="span_2">Default E-mail Client setting is SMTP</span>, the e-mail appears as a meeting request and includes a link to the Activity. Click <span class="span_2">Accept</span> to save the Reminder to the e-mail calendar.</p>
            <p><span>Authorization</span>: This field defaults to <span class="span_2">User</span> but includes an option of <span class="span_2">Manager.</span></p>
            <p><span>Security Level:</span> Select the desired security level from the pull-down menu where the permissions have been already established or click <span class="span_2">Advanced</span> to customize the settings for each particular user. The system comes defaulted with three group security levels. Add as many group security levels as you want, however. (See next section for details on how to add or modify group security levels.) </p>
            <p><span>1. Agent</span>: <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> comes with a default agent security profile. This is a sample of a recommended set of security rules for your agent already prepared by <span class="span_2">Trams</span> which can always be modified for each user login.</p>
            <p><span>2. Full Access</span>: Access made available to the owner or administrator of the agency.</p>
            <p><span>3. Read Only Access</span>: This access might be appropriate for a new contact during their probationary period or a temporary contact covering as vacation relief.</p>
            <p><span>Disable Account</span>: Placing a checkmark in the box denies the agent access to the program. The sign-in is no longer valid. This box is checked when the agent name cannot be deleted because there are entries pointing to that name in the database. Since <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> shares a database with <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span>, you see TBO users on the user list. Uncheck <span class="span_2">Disable Account</span>, if you want the TBO users to access <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>.</p>

            <p><span>Profile/Activity/ResCard</span><span> Rights</span>: Select from a drop-down list of choices to determine this agent’s ability to read, write and delete profile, activity, Res Card and inventory records captured in your database. <span class="span_2">Read Only</span> allows the agent to view the record only. <span class="span_2">Read/Write</span> allows the agent to view and modify the record, but not delete the record. <span class="span_2">Read/Write/Delete</span> permits the agent to view, modify and permanently remove the record.</p>
            <p><span>Inventory Rights: </span>Select from a drop-down list of choices to determine this agent’s ability to read, write and delete Inventory records captured in your database. <span class="span_2">Read Only</span> allows the agent to view the record only. <span class="span_2">Read/Write</span> allows the agent to view and modify the record, but not delete the record. <span class="span_2">Read/Write/Delete</span> permits the agent to view, modify and permanently remove the record.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p><span>Agent Rights: </span>This setting allows an agent who has the View Own Profiles, View Own Res Cards, and/or View Own Activities boxes checked on the Other Restrictions tab to also query for and access Profiles, Res Cards, and Activities associated with additional Agent(s) named here. </p>
            <p><span>Branch Rights: </span>Limit which branch records a specific user login can access. Keep in mind that if branch access is limited, then duplicate profiles may be created as a result of not locating profiles accordingly. We recommend use of this feature only if clients do not contact your agency across your branches. Check the box <span class="span_2">Limit User Branch Access</span>, then select from the listing of branches which branches this user <span>CAN</span> access. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. </p>
            <p>If a user login has been limited to view only a particular branch/es, then when Querying in the Profile Manager, Activity Manager or Res Card Manager, those branches with permission are always being included within the Query filters and only those records linked to the branch/es with permission appear in the results. Profiles must be linked to the branch/es with permission when Querying the Profile Manager. Activities must be linked to a profile that is linked to the branch/es with permission when Querying the Activity Manager. Res Cards must be linked to the branch/es with permission when Querying the Res Card Manager.</p>
            <p><span>Menu Options:</span> Allows the SYSDBA to further restrict permissions to select menu items within the database. For example, you may not want to grant a new user the ability to change the global default settings. In that case, you would uncheck the box next to Global Defaults, so the user cannot access the Global Default menu option. If you want to give an agent access to all global default settings except Marketing Codes, the Global Defaults box would remain checked but the Marketing Codes box would be left unchecked. Every menu option available to <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> is listed here for you to enable or disable for each agent. </p>

            <p>Each file manager (Profile, Activity, and Res Card) comes with a default set of folders, which represent a stored set of Query filters. In addition to the default folders, your agency and agents can create their own custom folders. This area of the user login allows you to identify which folder should be opened by default (within each manager) when first signing into <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Choose from the drop-down menu the types of transactions you want to see when first entering <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> with this login. </p>

            <p>Each profile type is made up of several folders or tabs of information. Under Profile Defaults, select which tab first appears when viewing each type of profile.

            <p>Default logic looks at User communication defaults for Country Code and Area Code and uses additional logic for defaulting the Country Code and Area Code in the phone format window under these conditions:</p>
            <p>**If the number entered into the phone field does not start with both a country code and area code, the digits entered default into the entry field and the User or Global communication default populates the Country/Area Code. Example: If User/Global communication default is 63 for the Country Code and 9 for the Area Code, a new phone number entered as 5551212 is saved as +63 (9) 5551212.</p>
            <p>**If the number entered into the phone field does not start with a country code, but does start with an Area Code, the area code lands in the area code section, remaining digits land into entry field and the User or Global communication default populates the Country Code. Example: If User/Global communication default is 63 for the Country Code, a new phone number entered as 95551212 is saved as +63 (9) 5551212.</p>
            <p>**If the number entered into the phone field starts with same numbers in the User or Global communication defaults, then the number is parsed out accordingly into Country Code, Area Code and Entry. Example: If User/Global communication default is 63 for the Country Code and 9 for the Area Code, a new phone number entered as 6395551212 is saved as +63 (9) 5551212.</p>

            <p>This set-up area is for agencies who want to use Live Connect in the Res Card. Save time and improve efficiency by transmitting selected client information to the booking engine (Live Connect Provider), then electronically transmitting back reservation details and automatically complete the reservation form with what’s been booked. Proceed to generate client quotes, itineraries, invoices, and trip statements. </p>
            <p>Set up for Live Connect agent logins can be done in two ways - globally (if all agents share the same user name, password or account number), or individually. When Live Connect is launched, the system first looks to see if there is login information at the User Login level, and if not, then looks for the login information at the Global Defaults level. </p>
            <p><span>Setting Up Global Login Information: </span>To enter one set of login information for a Live Connect provider for all agents to share, go to the Global Defaults menu and select <span class="span_2">Live Connect Login</span>. Click <span class="span_2">Add</span> and enter the following information:</p>
            <p><span>Live Connect Provider:</span> Select from the drop-down list.</p>
            <p><span>User Name, Password and Account Number:</span> Enter the necessary fields based upon the login information provided to you by the Live Connect provider.</p>
            <p><span>Setting up Individual Login Information: </span>To set up Live Connect for <span>each</span> user login, click on the Live Connect tab in the User Setting. Click <span class="span_2">Add </span>to add a Live Connect Provider User. <span>Tip: </span>Each agent can do their own Live Connect password setups under <span>Utilities|MyLogin. </span></p>
            <p>The Live Connect Provider is the "<span class="span_2">Booking Engine" </span>for many vendor sites. You must sign up with any Live Connect Provider you want to use to obtain the unique user name, password, and account number used below. See <span class="span_2">An In-Depth Look at Live Connect</span> for details on signing up for any Live Connect booking engine. <span>Note: </span>You can setup these settings globally by going to <span>Global Defaults|Res Card Defaults|Live Connect Login.</span></p>
            <p><span>Live Connect Provider:</span> Only a Live Connect Provider which is available for your use is listed on the drop-down menu list. Select one. </p>
            <p><span>User Name:</span> For each Live Connect Provider, enter the unique user name assigned to your agency when you registered.</p>
            <p><span>Password:</span> For each Live Connect Provider, enter the unique password assigned to your agency when you registered.</p>
            <p><span>Account Number:</span> For each Live Connect Provider, enter the unique account number assigned to your agency when you registered.</p>

If you decide to make a change to agent security and they are linked to an agent security level, by changing the group security level for agents in this area, each user login will automatically be updated with changes you make. Follow the easy steps below to establish the same security level (a master) for more than one user.</p>

            <p><span>Note:</span> Selecting a security level group simply defaults the permissions accordingly. You can change any of the permissions for just this user without affecting anyone else with this security level.</p>
            <p>4. Complete the Query folder defaults and profile defaults. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>.</p>
            <p>The permissions established for a group security level can be modified at any time and retroactively modify the permissions for any user login pointing to that group security level created to-date.</p>
            <p><span>Tip: </span>It’s a good idea under the Menu items in the Utilities to let users have permissions for <span class="span_2">My Login.</span></p>

                <img src="resources/images/chapter 3 set up clientbase for your agency1/setting up workstation level.png" style="height: 425px;width: 434px;" class="img_1" />

            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> was designed with optimal performance in mind. Since speed is a critical issue for <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to be effective, certain processes in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> can be designated as automatic or manual at the workstation level.</p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="General_Options_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>General Options Tab</h4>
            <p>In the <span class="span_2">General Options </span>tab, designate whether user wants big toolbar buttons, or a prompt before closing out of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. By default the automatic Query settings have been enabled and can be changed at the global level, but can be overwritten in here. For each manager, select if you want to <span class="span_2">Use Global Settings, Enable Automatic Queries, </span>or <span class="span_2">Disable Automatic Queries. </span>Remote users who connect to the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database need to disable automatically queries here and under the <span class="span_2">Profile Options</span> tab so they get optimum performance. </p>
            <p>Also globally setup is the way alarms are sent to the workstations. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> uses the <span class="span_2">IB Events</span> tool in Interbase to enable the server to automatically distribute alarms it detects to the workstations. By default this tool is activated globally. Some remote workstations, however, may have trouble getting alarms because of firewalls or the newest security measures Microsoft Windows has in place. For this reason, you have the ability to disable <span class="span_2">IE</span><span class="span_2">Events</span> that were setup for you globally, or to set this tool to <span class="span_2">Polling </span>(suggested)<span class="span_2">. </span>With <span class="span_2">Polling</span>, you can select to have the workstations poll (or Query) the server for any alarms periodically to send these alarms to them. By default we suggest the <span class="span_2">Polling </span>be set to every 2 minutes, but you can change this duration if you so choose. </p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="Profile_Options_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Profile Options Tab</h4>
            <p>By default the automatic Query settings for profile options have been enabled and can be changed at the global level, but can be overwritten in here. Under <span class="span_2">Profile Options</span> for Profile Indicators, Travel History and Payment History, select if you want to <span class="span_2">Use Global Settings, Enable Automatic Queries, </span>or <span class="span_2">Disable Automatic Queries. </span>Remote users who connect to the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database need to disable automatically queries here and under the <span class="span_2">General Options</span> tab so they get optimum performance.</p>
            <p class="p_10">Merge to PNR Settings</p>
            <p>Under the <span class="span_2">Merge to PNR Settings</span>, the workstation settings override the Global Defaults PNR settings, if selected. This area includes drop-down lists of choices including <span class="span_2">Use Global Settings, Use Clipboard, or Use API.</span></p>
            <p>For the <i>for Sabre</i> drop-down: <b>Use Global Setting</b>, <b>Use Clipboard</b>, <b>Use SRW 2.0 API</b>, or <b>Use  3.0 API.</b></p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/nsrw 3-0 api 2.png" />
            </p>
            <p>By default, all workstation defaults are set to <span class="span_2">Use Global Setting</span>, but can be overwritten on a workstation-by-workstation basis. </p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="PNR_Import_Settings_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>PNR Import Settings Tab</h4>
            <p>The <span class="span_2">PNR Import Settings </span>tab is used to input settings for use with our PNR import feature in the Res Card. Nothing needs to be setup in this tab at the workstation level. The <span class="span_2">Use Local Files for PNR Import</span> is for <span class="span_2">Trams</span> testing only.</p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="E-mail_Settings_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>E-mail Settings Tab</h4>
            <p>Click the <span class="span_2">E-mail Setting Tab</span> to override the current user's e-mail settings and assign a unique set of settings specific to a workstation. Only enter settings in this area to overwrite the settings for the current user, otherwise select <span class="span_2">Ignore</span> from the drop-down menu. If settings are entered, the merge to e-mail feature from this workstation uses these settings rather than those in the user login. Notice a setting to default the number of e-mails processed before a re-connection to the SMTP server is established. This feature can be disabled if the value is set to 0. (For a complete overview of use of SMTP versus MAPI - how to setup and how to use - please refer to the chapter <span class="span_2">E-mail Marketing in ClientBase</span>.)</p>
            <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="Spell_Checker" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor210"></a>Spell Checker</h3>
            <p>Several dictionaries have automatically been installed onto each workstation running <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> providing you with the ability to identify misspellings within Document Templates, Formatted Text E-mails, and Profile Remarks. By default, while typing within any of these three areas, the spell check feature automatically underlines each misspelled word. Right-click on a misspelled word and you will be offered suggested spellings along with the ability to <span class="span_2">Ignore, Ignore All </span>or<span class="span_2"> Add</span> to Dictionary. In addition a Spell Check button, labeled <span class="span_2">ABC</span> has been added to the toolbar of each of these features (Document Templates, Merge to E-mail and Profile Remarks) allowing you to run the spell check routine across all data captured.</p>
            <h4 class="Heading4"><a name="Customizing_Spell_Check_Utility_" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Customizing Spell Check Utility:</h4>
            <p>Although the spell check utility is automatically activated within Document Templates, Merge to E-mail and Profile Remarks, you can customize your spell check settings by going to <span>Workstation Defaults|Spell Checker</span>.</p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Dictionaries:</span> Several different language dictionaries have automatically been installed, although by default only the General English dictionary as been enabled. From this area, <span class="span_2">Add, Enable, Disable </span>or<span class="span_2"> Remove</span> dictionaries. <span>Note:</span> All dictionaries have been installed within the <span>My Documents\</span><span class="span_2">Trams</span><span>\Dictionary directory</span>.</p>
            <p><span>User Dictionaries:</span> A blank user dictionary is also automatically installed where you can customize the dictionaries used when running spell check to include words not currently in the General Dictionaries. When running spell checker if a word not recognized is <span class="span_2">added to dictionary</span>, the word is saved within this <span class="span_2">User Directory</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Options:</span> By default the spell checker is set to <span class="span_2">Ignore ALL CAP words</span>, <span class="span_2">Ignore Words with Numbers</span>, and <span class="span_2">Highlight misspelled words</span>. Remove the check from these settings to change the default.</p>

            <p><span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> gives the option of selecting big or small icons on your toolbar. This selection can be made from <span>Workstations|Toolbar</span>. Click <span class="span_2">Big Buttons</span> or <span class="span_2">Small Buttons</span> and the toolbar is adjusted accordingly.</p>
