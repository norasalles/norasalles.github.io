            <h1><a name="Get_To_KnowClientBase" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Get To KnowClientBase</h1>
            <p>This chapter provides a general overview of ClientBase. The features of the program are broadly discussed in this chapter with an in-depth look at each feature and agency application outlined in succeeding chapters.</p>
            <p>At the heart of ClientBase is the ability to locate, modify and use the information held within the agency database. This database contains a wealth of knowledge on past and present customers and vendors. Being able to easily access and use this valuable information to maintain existing relationships and build new ones may very well establish the future success of your agency. ClientBase is the tool of choice to easily access, manage, update and use this valuable database information. We’ll show you how! </p>
            <p>The first screen to appear after signing in is the ClientBase main screen. To become better acquainted with the ClientBase features, it may be helpful to think of the screen as being divided into six sections:</p>
            <p>1. Menu Items</p>
            <p>2. Toolbar</p>
            <p>3. File Manager</p>
            <p>4. Query Filters</p>
            <p>5. Results Window</p>
            <p>6. Status Bar</p>

            <h2><a name="Meet_the_Menu_Items" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor220"></a>Meet the Menu Items</h2>
            <p>Located at the top of the screen are menu items (File, Edit, Reports, Merge To, Workstation Defaults, Global Defaults, Utilities, Windows, and Help). Click the tabs or use hot keys (Alt + underlined letter) to get to the menu items. An arrow to the right of a menu indicates there are additional sub-menus for selection. Anything that needs to be done in <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> can be done from the main menu. </p>

            <h2><a name="Meet_the_Toolbar" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor221"></a>Meet the Toolbar</h2>
            <p>The toolbar provides short-cuts to frequently performed tasks such as creating a new profile, launching a document template, or moving profile data into a PNR. Placing a cursor on any of the icons on the toolbar brings up a call-out box describing its function. </p>

            <h2><a name="Meet_the_Query_Filters" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor222"></a>Meet the Query Filters</h2>
            <p>Your database holds a wealth of information on customers - marketing activities, reservations, and vendors. This information is of little value unless it can be quickly accessed when needed. The Query feature provides filters to quickly sift through data to match your required search criteria.</p>
            <p>Depending on which manager you are working in - Profile, Activity, Inventory, or Res Card, you have the capability to perform either a simple or complex search. The Query filters vary based on the applicable fields found within that manager. For example, choices in the Activity Manager are based on the fields found in reminders, notes and mailers. The Profile Manager includes those fields associated with any type of profile. The Res Card Manager allows searches for Res Cards using any Res Card fields as search criteria. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 5 getting to know clientbase1/meet the toolbar_1.jpg" style="height: 120px;width: 449px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Getting%20To%20Know%20ClientBase%20Plus.09.1.05.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <h3><a name="Query_Level_1" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor223"></a>Query Level 1</h3>
            <p>Use Query Level 1 level to quickly locate a profile or a group of profiles by simply completing one or two Query filters. The drop-down field to the left identifies what to search by, and the blank field to the right allows you to type in what you want to search for. If both fields are used in this Query, then the results match both criteria, not either/or. This means the Query filters are strung together with an “and” not an "or". (Another way of saying this is that <span>All</span> fields are evaluated to form the results of the Query, instead of <span>Any</span> filter selected within one field being evaluated to form the results of the Query.) For example, if you are looking for an leisure client named Harry Ford, then set the first field to Profile Type and select <span class="span_40">Leisure</span>, then set the second field to Last Name and enter “Ford”. All Leisure Clients with the Last Name of Ford appear in the Query results. </p>
            <h3><a name="Query_Level_2" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor224"></a>Query Level 2 </h3>
            <p>The Query Level 2 provides additional filters that more narrowly define a search. Search filters are selected by clicking <span class="span_40">Filter, </span>and then completing as many of the search criteria fields as desired. Each field selected is strung together with an “and” (matches <span>all</span>) that more narrowly defines the Query. Inside the Marketing Tables, if multiple Marketing Codes are selected these are strung together with an "or" (matches <span>any</span>). For example, if you have just received a hot cruise special to Europe and want to send a mailing to all past and potential cruise clients interested in Europe and living in the 90045 zip code, you would put the following filters in your Query. First select <span class="span_40">Leisure</span> under <span class="span_40">Profile Type; 90045</span> in <span class="span_40">Zip</span>; <span class="span_40">Europe</span> and <span class="span_40">Cruise</span> under <span class="span_40">Marketing </span>categories, and click <span class="span_40">OK. </span>Now you have selected the filters to Query your database for all leisure clients who expressed an interest in cruising and want to go to Europe and live in the 90045 zip code area. When you click <span class="span_40">OK, </span>all clients in your database meeting the selection criteria are displayed on the results screen. You are now ready to print your labels and send the mailing.</p>
            <p>

            <h3><a name="Query_Level_3" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor225"></a>Query Level 3 </h3>
            <p>The Query Level 3 provides users with an even greater ability to more narrowly define a search. This Query is available in all managers. As detailed above, Level 2 Query allows a search by any number of fields, stringing one statement of criteria together with an “and.” Query Level 3 strings <span class="span_3">multiple</span> statements of criteria together with an “or,” using <span class="span_40">search method options</span> (operators) to define how the criteria should filter. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 5 getting to know clientbase1/meet the toolbar_3.jpg" style="height: 378px;width: 524px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Getting%20To%20Know%20ClientBase%20Plus.09.1.07.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>The <span class="span_40">Filter Type </span>for Communication, Activities, Family/Contact, Cards, Res Cards and Travel History tabs renders the queries even more user-friendly and flexible:</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Blank Filter Type</span>: By default a new Query has this Filter Type blank, which means the Query is not be filtered in any way by that tab of information. </p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Does Have Records with the following criteria: </span>If this option is selected and no other search criteria is entered in that tab, then only profiles that have that type of record are included. For example, if you set the Travel History Filter Type to "Does Have Travel History Records with the following criteria" and no further criteria is entered, then this Query returns only profiles that have any kind of Travel History. If you enter further search criteria in this tab, then each criteria is strung together with an "and" and the system looks for at least 1 record that meets <span>all</span> the criteria (in the example of Travel History, it looks for at least one invoice that meets <span>all</span> the criteria) and if at least 1 record is found, then the profile with that record is included within the results.</p>
            <p><span class="span_40">Does Not Have Records with the following criteria:</span> If this option is selected and no search criteria is entered, then only profiles that do not have any of that type of record are included. For example, if you set the Travel History Filter Type to "Does Not Have Travel History Records with the following criteria" and no further criteria is entered, then this Query returns only profiles that have never purchased anything from your agency (those with no invoices). If you enter further search criteria in this tab, then think of this option as an "Exclude", which means it doesn't matter whether the profile has that type of record or not, exclude them if they do have that type of record that meets all of the additional search criteria.</p>
            <p>Search operators <span class="span_40">Is Equal to Any</span> and <span class="span_40">Is Not Equal to Any</span> are also located within a Level 3 Query. When either operator is selected, rather then forcing you to select one filter from the drop down list, you are now able to select multiple filters from the drop down list by placing a check in the desired choices. When multiple filters are selected within one field, each filter is strung together with an "or". (Another way of saying this is that <span>Any</span> filter selected within one field is evaluated to form the result of the Query.) </p>
            <p class="p_62">For example, if you set your Search Operator for State to <span class="span_40">Is Equal to Any</span> and check CA, AZ, and WA from your drop down list, after setting the Profile Type to <span class="span_40">Leisure</span>, then your Query returns all profiles that are Leisure <span>AND</span> are in either CA, AZ, <span>OR</span> WA. In addition to selecting from the drop-down list, you can also free flow your filter if the search operator is set to <span class="span_40">Is Equal to Any</span> or <span class="span_40">Is Not Equal to Any</span>. When free flowing filters, to include more than one filter, then type each filter in and separate each with a comma ",". For example, if you don't have states entered into your drop down list, but would like to filter on CA, AZ or WA then set your Search Operator to <span class="span_40">Is Equal to Any</span> and type into the State field <span class="span_40">CA,AZ,WA</span>. </p>
            <p><span>Note on Sorting in Level 3 Query: </span>Values entered into Alpha-numeric fields are always treated as STRINGS, so they do not sort in numeric order. If you want to use the fields to enter numeric values, then pre-determine the maximum digits that will be used, and start entering number with zeros in front..... for example, 00001, 00002, 00003, 00004, 00005, etc. Note that you can use less than/greater than when Querying for Alpha-numeric fields to filter for ranges of records. For example, you want to Query for values that begins with letter A thru R. Filter for Less than "S", or use Less Than or Equal to "R". </p>
            <h2><a name="Meet_the_Query_Results" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor226"></a>Meet the Query Results</h2>
            <p>The results screen displays the results of your Query based on the criteria entered into the Query filters. Only those records that meet the criteria of the Query filters are included in the Query results. While working in the Profile Manager, all Query results are displayed by profile (Leisure, Corporate, Vendor, Agent, Service Provider, and Other). While working in the Activity Manager, all Query results are displayed by activity (Notes, Reminders and Mailers). While working in the Res Card Manager, all Query results are displayed by Res Card. </p>
            <p>In the example below, the Query filters have been entered from the Profile Manager and set to profile type of <span class="span_40">Leisure</span> and <span class="span_40">City </span>starting with<span class="span_40">, </span>Manhattan. The Query Results displays all leisure clients in the database whose city is Manhattan Beach. To select a record appearing within the results screen, double-click the entry and the profile details appear.</p>

            <h3><a name="Query_Results_Count" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Query Results Count </h3>
            <p>Click <span class="span_40">Count</span> to find out how many profiles meet the results of the Query filters currently selected. In this next example, we are working in the Activity Manager and have entered our desired Query filters. The Query results displays all activities in the database that are open reminders for agent Sharon. To select a record appearing within the results screen, double-click the entry and the activity details appear. To view the profile an activity was created for, click once on the activity to highlight it, then click <span class="span_40">Go To Profile</span> on the toolbar. <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> allows easy navigation between the activities in the results screen and the profiles for which the activities were created.</p>

            <h2><a name="Meet_the_File_Manager" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor227"></a>Meet the File Manager</h2>
            <p>Located to the left of the screen is the <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> File Manager. To assist you with managing a rather elaborate database of information, the File Manager is divided into 6 Tabs:</p>
            <p>(1) <span class="span_40">Profile Manager</span> allows easy management of profile data (Leisure, Corporate, Vendor, Agent, Service Provider, and Other) and provides Query filters and results listed by profile.</p>
            <p>(2) <span class="span_40">Activity Manager</span> allows easy management of activity data (Notes, Reminders and Mailers) and provides Query filters and results listed by activity.</p>
            <p>(3) <span class="span_40">Res Card Manager</span> allows easy management of Res Card data and provides Query filters and results listed by Res Cards.</p>
            <p>Although the system comes with a default set of folders within each File Manager, these folders are completely user-definable. Simply enter the desired Query filters, arrange columns as desired, then click <span class="span_40">File</span> and <span class="span_40">Save Query As</span> to save as a folder within the File Manager. Folders can be saved on a global level, meaning this folder is available to all users; or they can be saved on a personal level, which means this folder is only available for a unique user login. To select a folder from the File Manager, simply click the folder and the system automatically completes the Query filters, sifts through the data, and displays the outcome in the Query results window. To rename or delete a folder, right-click the folder name. </p>
            <p>(4) <span class="span_40">Internet Manager</span> allows you to seamlessly link to the Internet without leaving <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> or launching another browser application. Easily manage Global and Personal Internet sites, by clicking saved folders to automatically launch your default browser and take you to the selected website.</p>
            <p>The Internet Manager comes with some default folders for your convenience. Among these are <span class="span_40">Passport Online,</span><span class="span_40">Trams Training Options, </span>and <span class="span_40">AIPlus E-Postcards. Passport Online and AI E-Postcards</span> provide specials and postcards with raw HTML formatting that can be used with SMTP e-mail (please refer to chapter entitled, <span class="span_40">E-mail Marketing in ClientBase.)</span></p>
            <p>(5) <span class="span_40">Inventory Manager </span>allows easy management of inventory data and provides Query filters and results listed by inventory items. The Inventory Manager comes with some global default folders for your convenience including Air, Cruise, Hotel, Rail, Tour, and Misc.</p>
            <p>The file folders listed within each tab of the File Manager represent a set of Query filters and column arrangements that have been saved and named as a folder. With a single click of the mouse, these folders automatically complete Query filters to display Query results.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Although the system comes with a default set of folders within each File Manager, these folders are completely user-definable. Simply enter the desired Query filters, arrange columns as desired, then click <span class="span_40">File</span> and <span class="span_40">Save Query As</span> to save as a folder within the File Manager. Folders can be saved on a global level, meaning this folder is available to all users; or they can be saved on a personal level, which means this folder is only available for a unique user login. To select a folder from the File Manager, simply click the folder and the system automatically completes the Query filters, sifts through the data, and displays the outcome in the Query results window. To rename or delete a folder, right-click the folder name. </p>
            <p>(6) <span class="span_40">DashBoard</span> - Just like a car dashboard that provides a panel of quick visual cues of critical information at a glance, the agency Dashboard feature provides significant data at a glance for owners/managers and agents to use to monitor different facets of the business such as sales and marketing. </p>
            <h2><a name="Meet_the_Managers" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Meet the Managers</h2>
            <p>Each of the managers represents a different view of the entire database (<span class="span_40">ClientBase</span> is really broken into 4 mini-databases - with the exception of the Internet Manager and Dashboard areas- that organize and maintain a portion of the data held within the program database). The information in these mini-databases can be managed, updated and filtered with the Query outcome displayed on the results screen. Whether you want to search your database of profiles, activities, inventory, or Res Cards (or use the Internet Manager to launch your default browser to take you to a selected website) determines which of the managers to select.</p>
            <h3><a name="Profile_Manager" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor228"></a>Profile Manager</h3>
            <p class="p_12">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 5 getting to know clientbase1/right mouse click in the results_2.jpg" style="height: 396px;width: 585px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Getting%20To%20Know%20ClientBase%20Plus.09.1.11.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Clicking the Profile Manager tab provides fields for Query and management of the database of profiles. Stored folders and Query fields for the Profile Manager appear, as well as Query results displayed by profile. The Profile Manager provides agents with quick access to vital information about clients, vendors, inventory, agents and other profiles. From this area, <span class="span_40">locate, add, modify </span>or <span class="span_40">delete</span> profile records. Use the results of a Query or a selected profile to merge profile data into a label, document template, PNR, or e-mail. Also print reports based on the results of a profile Query to gain valuable insight into the data contained within profiles.</p>
            <p>When opening the Profile Manager no Query filters are entered by default, so the entire database of all profile types appears in the Query results screen. (Unless a particular folder has been setup in user logins to open in the result screen when the program is entered.) To filter the database results, either click a folder which contains a stored set of Query fields or use Level 1, 2, 3 Query fields to enter a custom Query. </p>
            <p>The results screen provides easy access to profile information such as address and phone numbers, to customer preferences, traveler details, activities, travel history, payment information, Res Cards and free-flow remarks. To retrieve a specific profile, highlight the entry and double click.</p>
            <p>A new profile can be created at any time by clicking <span>File|New</span>, by clicking on the first toolbar icon, or by right mouse clicking in the results screen. More than one profile can be open simultaneously allowing for multitasking flexibility. Use the <span class="span_40">Windows </span>menu item to display a listing of each open profile (or other open function) and easily move among them.</p>
            <h3><a name="Activity_Manager" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor229"></a>Activity Manager</h3>

            <p>Accessing the Activity Manager allows Query and management of the database of marketing activities, thus, providing quick and easy access to all reminders, notes and mailers. This powerful tool provides a means to become more organized and gives the ability to monitor a multitude of tasks and marketing activities.</p>
            <p>Stored folders and Query fields for the Activity Manager appear, as well as Query results, displayed by activity. From this area, view a To-Do list and <span class="span_40">locate, add, modify </span>or <span class="span_40">delete</span> notes, reminders and mailers. Use the results of a Query or a selected activity to merge profile data into a label, document template, PNR, or e-mail. Also print reports based on the results of the activity Query to gain valuable insight into the data contained with the database of marketing activities.</p>
            <p>When the Activities Manager is opened, the system automatically defaults to open reminders based on the current user login, thus providing an instant detailed <span class="span_40">To-Do</span> list. To change the type of activities displayed in the results screen, click a folder containing a stored set of Query fields or select Query Level 1, 2, or 3 to enter a custom Query. Next, click <span class="span_40">Run</span> to display the Query outcome on the results screen.</p>
            <p>To retrieve a specific activity, simply double-click the desired result. To easily move into the profile record for an activity appearing in the results screen, click <span class="span_40">Go To</span> on the toolbar. This allows you not only to Query the database of activities, but also move easily between the results and the profile details for which they were created. From within the Activity Manager, in addition to the Query results screen, the following views of reminders make managing a schedule and automating a day planner a snap. Click <span class="span_40">At A Glance</span> icon on toolbar.</p>

            <h3><a name="Res_Card_Manager" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor230"></a>Res Card Manager</h3>
            <p>The Res Card Manager provides an automated way to Query and manage the database of reservation data, thus, providing access to all Res Card records stored in <span class="span_40">ClientBase</span>. It is a powerful reservation manager designed, not to replace the GDS, but rather to provide a tool for tracking reservations that are not booked through the GDS; for example, those that are booked on-line or over the telephone.</p>
            <p>The Res Card Manager replaces the paper index Res Card and file folders that have for years cluttered agencies. In the past, agents entered details of many leisure type reservations (client information, confirmation numbers, itineraries, vendor information, remarks etc.) on cards or just loose paper. Agents kept these cards somewhere on their desk or somewhere in the file. That “somewhere” translated into precious time spent searching for Res Cards, especially when the booking agent was not available and another agent had to locate the card. With the Res Card Manager, you have the tool to organize and maintain reservation information in a central database. When a customer calls, any agent can now answer questions or update information by accessing the Res Card with the customer's travel details.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Upon entering the Res Card Manager, the stored folders and Query fields for the Res Card Manager appear, along with the Query results displayed by Res Card record. From this area easily generate invoices, update reservation details, track payments received or pending, as well as all of the other details involved in planning a trip. Use the results of a Query or a selected Res Card to merge the profile data into a label, document template, PNR, or e-mail. Also print reports based on the results of a Res Card Query and gain valuable insight into the data contained within your database of automated Res Cards.</p>

The Dashboard branch filter defaults to the last branch or set of branches selected. When reports are run by agent, the agent sees information for branches based on their user permission Branch Rights. If user branch access is not limited, agent will see all activity for their user for whatever branches they have activity created.</p>
