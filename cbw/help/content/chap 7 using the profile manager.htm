            <h1><a name="Using_the_Profile_Manager_to_Manage_Your_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor15"></a>Using the Profile Manager to Manage Your Profiles</h1>
            <p class="p_2">This chapter demonstrates how to use the Profile Manager feature in ClientBase.</p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..87" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Located on the left of the main screen within the File Manager are five tabs. Each tab represents one of the five File Managers (Profiles, Activities and Res Cards, Inventory, and Internet). The Profile Manager is an area to Query and manage your agency’s database of profiles. Stored folders and Query fields for the Profile Manager appear, as well as any Query results, displayed by profile.</p>
            <p>The Profile Manager provides agents with quick access to vital information about clients, vendors (including service providers), agents and other profiles. From this area, not only can you go into the profile to access every detail of the record, you can also <span class="span_2">locate, add, modify </span>or <span class="span_2">delete</span> profile records. Use the results of a Query or a selected profile to merge profile data into a label, document template, PNR, e-mail or file. You can also print reports based on the results of a profile Query and gain valuable insight into the data contained with your database of profiles.</p>
            <h2><a name="Changes_to_Queries_in_Version_3.08.xx_and_above" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Changes to Queries in Version 3.08.xx and above</h2>
            <p>Starting in ClientBase version 3.08 and above queries have been enhanced to work with addresses at both the Traveler and the Profile level. Level 1 query by address includes both Profile and Traveler addresses. For Level 2 and Level 3 queries, Address queries on the General Info tab include both Profile and Traveler addresses, if none of the Address Type boxes are checked. Once any Type box is checked, only Profile addresses of that type are included. In order to query only for Traveler addresses, users must go to the Traveler/Contact tab. </p>
            <p>Because Travelers can now be linked to multiple Profiles, queries by communication entry will display all profiles that the traveler is linked to. Also, because a profile and a passenger can have a primary communication, multiple primaries may exist for the same record. </p>
            <p>The logic of queries on communication entries has been modified. Now, when a user queries by email address, phone number, etc., the query looks at both the Profile and Traveler communication entries and returns the result. If the Primary box is checked when querying, the Profile's Primary communication entries and the Primary Traveler's Primary communication entries are both searched. When querying by communication entries from the Traveler tab, only Traveler level communication entries are searched. </p>

            </p>
            <p>When first opening the Profile Manager, by default no Query filters are entered. Therefore, your entire database of all profile types appears in the Query results screen. To filter the database results, either click a folder containing a stored set of Query fields, or use Level 1, 2, or 3 Query fields to filter your database and enter a custom Query. </p>
            <p>A list of Query folders is located to the left of the Profile Manager. The global folders are accessible to anyone for general viewing. Personal folders contain saved queries created by users and customized for their own particular user login. By clicking any of these folders, see the completed filters used for this stored Query, and a listing on the results screen of all profiles meeting the criteria of the selected Query filters. Query folders can be moved into any order you want by clicking the folder and dragging it to its new location.</p>
            <h3><a name="Query_Level_1_Filters" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor17"></a>Query Level 1 Filters</h3>
            <p class="p_3">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_1.jpg" style="height: 120px;width: 437px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Profile%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Profiles.11.1.02.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>The Query Level 1 allows you to quickly locate a profile or a group of profiles by simply completing one or two Query filters. The drop-down menu fields identify what you want to <span class="span_2">search by</span> and are completed by selecting from the following: <span class="span_2">Profile Type, Profile Name, Company, Last Name, Family/Traveler Name, Phone, Fax, e-mail, Website, Family/Traveler Phone, Interface ID, City, State, Zip, Branch, Primary Agent, and Profile No.</span></p>
            <p>The blank fields are there for you to type in what you want to search for, and are completed by typing in free-flow information. To prevent spelling errors, it is suggested that you type no more than 3 or 4 characters in the free-flowing fields. If both fields are used in this Query, then the results match both criteria, not either/or. This means the Query filters are strung together with an “and” not an “or”. (Another way of saying this is that <span>All</span> fields are evaluated to form the results of the Query, instead of <span>Any</span> filter selected within one field being evaluated to form the result of the Query.) After completing or changing data in the filters, the system automatically sifts through the database and displays the matching profiles in the Query results screen.</p>
            <p>For example, if you are looking for an leisure client named Harry Ford, then set the first field to <span class="span_2">Profile Type</span> and select <span class="span_2">Leisure </span>from the drop-down. Then as you type in “F,” your clients starting with F appear, as you type in “Fo”, the system filters the database further and just displays those clients starting with Fo. If you type in the full last name of “Ford”, then only those leisure clients with the last name of Ford appears in the Query results: </p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Tip:</span> You can easily filter by Branch or Primary Agent as part of a basic Level 1 Query by selecting those fields as selection criteria. Save a folder with these as filters by following directions below in the section entitled, <span class="span_2">Saving Queries for Easy Access</span>.</p>
            <h3><a name="Query_Level_2_Filters" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor18"></a>Query Level 2 Filters</h3>
            <p>The Query Level 2 provides additional filters that allow you to more narrowly define a search. Search filters are selected by clicking <span class="span_2">Filter </span>and then completing as many of the search criteria fields as desired. Since Level 2 Query “remembers” the last Query run, click <span class="span_2">Reset</span> to clear. Always do this first when running a Level 2 Query, as there may be data remaining in the many search folders from the last search. Profile folder tabs such as <span class="span_2">General Info, Marketing, Activities, Travelers/Contact, Cards, ResCards, More Fields and Travel History </span>are available for selection criteria entry. Query across all tabs of information. Like Level 1 Query, the selection criteria entered within a tab or across tabs are strung together with “ands”, so the resulting profiles must match <span>ALL</span> criteria.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_3.jpg" style="height: 401px;width: 497px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Profile%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Profiles.11.1.04.jpg" class="img_1" /> </p>
            <p>By clicking <span class="span_2">OK</span>, the Query is completed and a list of profiles matching the selection criteria appears on the results screen. </p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> You want to send a “Welcome to Our Agency Letter”, to all the client profiles created this month. By using the Level 2 filters, under the general info tab, you fill in the <span class="span_2">Profile Create Date </span>fields with the month parameters and click OK to run the Query. After reviewing, you are ready to merge the list into the welcome letter.</p>
            <p>When using marketing tables/codes as selection criteria in a Level 2 Query, you can use multiple marketing tables and even multiple marketing codes within your search criteria. Any codes entered are “anded” together across the tables, but “or’d” together within a table. For example, if you place a check in the Cruise code within the <span class="span_2">What Type</span> table and a check in the Deluxe code within the <span class="span_2">What Budget</span> table, you only get clients that are coded for <span>both</span> codes, in other words, Deluxe Cruisers. If you place a check in the Cruise code and a check in the Tour code within the same <span class="span_2">What Type</span> table, you get clients that are coded with <span>either</span> Cruise or Tour.</p>
            <h3><a name="Querying_for_Inactive_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor19"></a>Querying for Inactive Profiles</h3>
            <p>Use Level 2 Query to find <span class="span_2">Inactive Profiles.</span> Click <span class="span_2">Filter </span>and from the drop-down <span class="span_2">Profile Status </span>menu, choose <span class="span_2">Inactive.</span> All inactive profiles now appear in the results screen for easy access.</p>
            <h3><a name="Level_3_Query_Filters" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor20"></a>Level 3 Query Filters</h3>
            <p>The Query Level 3 provides users with an even greater ability to more narrowly define a search. As detailed above, Level 2 Query allows a search by any number of fields, stringing one statement of criteria together with an “and.” Query Level 3 strings <span class="span_3">multiple</span> statements of criteria together with an “or,” using <span class="span_2">search method options</span> to define how the criteria should filter. The Level 3 Query has a totally different look from Level 2 Query:</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_624x354.png" style="width: 624;height: 354;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>There are a set of buttons including <span class="span_2">Add Filter, </span><span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter, </span><span class="span_2">Modify Filter, Delete Filter, Reset All </span>(to clear out all filters currently displayed)<span>, </span>and <span class="span_2">Summarize</span>. Notice there is nothing to view in the results screen. This is because you need to setup the criteria statement(s) and click <span class="span_2">Refresh</span> to see the Level 3 Query results. </p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>It is not necessary to completely re-enter the criteria when adding similar filters. Once the first filter has been added to a Level 3 query, the <span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter</span> button is enabled. When clicked, a Level 3 query screen is opened, pre-populated with all of the criteria from the selected filter. Users can also right-click on a filter and select <span class="span_2">Duplicate Filter</span>.</p>
            <p>To enter the search criteria into Level 3 Query, click <span class="span_2">Add Filter</span>: </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_4.jpg" style="height: 349px;width: 485px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Profile%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Profiles.11.1.06.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Profile folder tabs such as <span class="span_2">General Info, Marketing, Activities, Travelers/Contact, Cards, ResCards, More Fields and Travel History </span>are available for selection criteria entry. What is unique about the Level 3 Query is that each available search field is divided into two parts. Directly to the left of the field, is a box with a drop-down menu of search method options, called <span class="span_2">Operators</span> with which you can narrow down your search. Operators include: <span>Is Equal to; Less than or Equal to; Greater than or Equal to; Less than, Greater than, Not Equal to; Starts With; Contains; Is BLANK; and Is NOT BLANK</span>. After choosing the appropriate option, tab to the next field to enter criteria you are matching. Always include an operator with any field you use.</p>
            <p>The Communication, Activities, Family/Contact, Cards, Res Cards and Travel History tabs are designed to make the queries more user-friendly and flexible. Since each of these tabs allow for multiple records within one profile, there’s a filter called <span class="span_2">Filter Type</span> which includes the following three options - <span class="span_2">Blank Filter Type, Does Have Records with the following criteria, </span>and <span class="span_2">Does Not Have Records with the following criteria. </span>By default a new Query has this <span class="span_2">Filter Type</span> blank, which means the Query is not filtered in any way by that tab of information. </p>
            <p><span>Blank Filter Type:</span> By default a new Query has this Filter Type blank, meaning the Query is not filtered in any way by that tab of information.</p>
            <p><span>Does Have Records with the following criteria:</span> If this option is selected and no other search criteria is entered in that tab, then only profiles that have that type of record are included. For example, if you set the Travel History Filter Type to "Does Have Travel History Records with the following criteria" and no further criteria is entered, then this Query returns only profiles that have any kind of Travel History. If you enter further search criteria in this tab, then each criteria is strung together with an "and," and the system looks for at least 1 record that meets <span>ALL</span> the criteria (in the example of Travel History it looks for at least one invoice that meets all the criteria) and if at least 1 record is found, then the profile with that record is included within the results.</p>
            <p><span>Does Not Have Records with the following criteria:</span> If this option is selected and no search criteria is entered, then only profiles that do not have any of that type of record are included. For example, if you set the Travel History Filter Type to "Does Not Have Travel History Records with the following criteria" and no further criteria is entered, then this Query returns only profiles that have never purchased anything from your agency (those with no invoices). If you enter further search criteria in this tab, then think of this option as an "Exclude", which means it doesn't matter whether the profile has that type of record or not, exclude them if they do have that type of record that meets all of the additional search criteria.</p>
            <p><span>Search Operators </span><span class="span_2">Is Equal to Any</span><span> and </span><span class="span_2">Is Not Equal to Any</span><span> to the below fields located within a Level 3 Query: </span>When either operator is selected, rather than forcing you to select one filter from the drop-down list, you are able to select multiple filters from the drop-down list by placing a check in the desired choices. When multiple filters are selected within one field, each filter is strung together with an "or" (another way of saying this is <span>Any</span> filter selected within one field is evaluated to form the result of the Query). For example, if you set the <span class="span_2">Search Operator </span>for <span class="span_2">State</span> to <span class="span_2">Is Equal to Any,</span> and check CA, AZ, and WA, and you set the <span class="span_2">Profile Type</span> to <span class="span_2">Leisure</span>, then the Query returns all profiles that are Leisure AND are in either CA, AZ <span>OR</span> WA. In addition to selecting from the drop-down list, you can also free flow your filter if the <span class="span_2">Search Operator</span> is set to <span class="span_2">Is Equal to Any</span> or <span class="span_2">Is Not Equal to Any</span>. When free flowing filters, if you would like more than one filter included then type each filter in and separate each with a comma ",". For example, if you don't have states entered into the drop-down list, but would like to filter on CA, AZ OR WA, then set the <span class="span_2">Search Operator</span> to <span class="span_2">Is Equal to Any,</span> and type into the <span class="span_2">State</span> field <span class="span_2">CA,AZ,WA</span> (there are no spaces). <span class="span_2">Is Equal to Any </span>or <span class="span_2">Is Not Equal to Any</span> are found in:</p>
            <p><span>General Info:</span> Courtesy Title, Zip Code, City, State, Group, Referred By, Branch, Create User, Modified User.</p>
            <p><span>Communication:</span> Description.</p>
            <p><span>Activities:</span> Login Name, Reminder Type, Subject.</p>
            <p><span>Family/Contact:</span> Relationship with Profile, Courtesy Title, Citizenship, Passport, Issuing City, Passport Issuing Country.</p>
            <p><span>Cards:</span> Card Type, Card Code, Card Description.</p>
            <p><span>Res Cards:</span> Reservation Cycle, Lead Source, Group, Region, Booking System, Booking Status, Air Code.</p>
            <p><span>More Fields: </span>All.</p>
            <p><span>Hint for </span><span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span><span> Users: </span>Some of the marketing information you have been capturing (sometime for years) in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> does not appear in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Notice the folder in the Level 3 Query Screen called <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office Marketing Fields</span>. You can Query up profiles you have been collecting information on in <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> using the marketing fields: <span>Business Affil., Other, Notes, Add’l Notes, Stmt Remarks, and Travel Pref. </span>Once you have retrieved these profiles, go to the <span>Utilities|Global Modify</span> feature and globally modify these profiles by marking them with appropriate marketing codes. Now all this marketing information is present in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> profile marketing tab.</p>
            <p><span>Note on Sorting in Level 3 Query: </span>Values entered into Alpha-numeric fields are always treated as STRINGS, so they do not sort in numeric order. If you want to use the fields to enter numeric values, then pre-determine the maximum digits that will be used, and start entering number with zeros in front..... for example, 00001, 00002, 00003, 00004, 00005, etc. Note that you can use less than/greater than when Querying for Alpha-numeric fields to filter for ranges of records. For example, you want to Query for values that begins with letter A thru R. Filter for Less than "S", or use Less Than or Equal to "R".</p>

            <h3><a name="Using_Date_Formulas_in_Queries_..88" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor22"></a>Using Date Formulas in Queries</h3>
            <p>Since queries can be saved and retrieved for frequent use, the date fields in all queries allow for date formulas. This means any field that has a date, can also contain a formula for that date. The date formula function allows you to create a Query without identifying a specific month, day and year in the <span class="span_2">From</span> and <span class="span_2">To</span> date fields. Instead, the Query is processed with a formula for the month, day, day of the week, and year based upon the date the report is processed. <span>Remember: </span>Make sure system date and time are correct. When a date formula is entered, the system converts it to your intended time period allowing you to run queries and/or save them for future use without the need to modify dates.</p>
            <p><span>Example:</span> The following tables contain sample formulas for specifying dates. Mix and match the absolute and relative parameters in the function. The first number specifies the day of the month, the second number specifies the month, and the third number specifies the year. So if you only have the first number filled in, this means you want this report to reoccur on this day every month, in every year.</p>

                <br />The Results Screen</h3>
            <p>After you have completed a Query using Level 1, 2, or 3 filters, the results screen not only provides a count and list of Query results, but also easy access to a specific profile. To obtain a count of the Query results, click <span class="span_2">Count</span> (located just above the results screen). To retrieve any profile, simply double-click the desired highlighted entry. This takes you into the profile folder to access any of the profile tabs discussed in greater detail in the “In-Depth” chapters of this manual. You can also highlight a profile in the results screen to merge with a specific toolbar function:</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Some of the toolbar functions such as <span class="span_2">Print, Label, Letter </span>and<span class="span_2"> e-mail</span> can be used for all results of the Query; or if you prefer, just selected results by holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key and, with your mouse, selecting consecutive or non-consecutive entries. In this case, a dialog box appears asking you if you want to use the current results in the Profile Manager, use selected results in the Profile Manager, or if you want to reQuery the Profile Manager. </p>
            <p>This function is discussed in much greater detail in the chapter entitled, <span>Putting Profiles to Work for You</span>.</p>

            <h2><a name="Saving_Queries_for_Easy_Access_..89" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor24"></a>Saving Queries for Easy Access</h2>
            <p>As you can see, queries run in the Profile Manager can become quite complex. With all the available filters in Level 1, 2 and 3, you can view the database inside out, upside down or in just about any subset you desire. With this in mind, if there are certain queries that you want to run often, we suggest you save the Query filters after setting them up. This is called saving a Query to a folder. One click on a saved Query folder, and the Query filters are completed automatically. What a time saver!</p>
            <p>Here are steps for saving a Query in the Profile Manager:</p>
            <p>1) Using Level 1, 2, or 3 filter parameters in the Profile Manager, enter Query filters and run your Query. (Use date formulas as described above if applicable.)</p>
            <p>2) To customize the columns used in the Query, click <span class="span_2">Columns</span> above the Profile Manager results screen.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_9.jpg" style="height: 313px;width: 426px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Profile%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Profiles.11.1.11.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>To change a column, move the highlighted column over to the other side by using the <span>&gt;</span> or <span>&lt; </span>arrow. By using the shift key and mouse, select as many consecutive entries as you want to move and use the <span>&gt;</span> or <span>&lt; </span>arrows. By using the control key and your mouse, you can select non-consecutive entries to move. Use the up and down arrows to order the selections. To sort up to 3 columns in ascending or descending order, click <span class="span_2">Sort by Columns. </span>You can also arrange, size, and sort the columns in the Query on the result screen by inserting the mouse between the column headers (see a bi-directional arrow), holding down the left-mouse button, and pulling the columns to the new size. Pull any column to a new location by using the mouse. To sort, hold down <span class="span_2">Shift</span> and click a column header one time for ascending order, and once again for descending order.</p>

            <p>3) When satisfied with the Query results, go to <span>File|Save Query As</span>. This screen appears:</p>

            </p>
            <p>4) From the drop-down Level menu, choose whether you want the Query to be <span class="span_2">Personal</span> (for your own use only), or <span class="span_2">Global</span> (for the use of everyone in the agency).</p>
            <p>5) Name the Query.</p>
            <p><span>Quick Tip: </span>Starting in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> version 3.01, there are a series of suggested Saved Queries under the Personal folders for the SYSDBA login. If there is one of these you want to use, double-click on the folder to open it, and save it as a Global folder. Logging in with your own user name, find the saved Query folder. Leave it as a Global folder for all to use, or save it as Personal folder, and delete it from the Global area.</p>
            <p>6) Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. The new query folder is located on the left hand side of the Profile Manager screen:</p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> saves the filters and results layout, <span>not</span> the query results. The next time you use the saved query, any new data that has been added since it was created, is included in the new query. </p>

            <p>When customers contact the agency, the first thing an agent does is check the Profile Manager to determine if that customer is in the database. Do this by querying in the Profile Manager as detailed above. Avoid creating duplicate profiles! If a client is not in the agency’s <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> database, the agent needs to create a new customer profile. This can be done in 3 ways and for each option, you will be launched into a Quick Entry Form.</p>
            <p>The first way is to right-mouse click in the Profile Manager results screen.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_13_270x309.jpg" style="width: 270;height: 309;" />
            </p>
            <p>After clicking <span class="span_2">Add</span>, a submenu appears for you to select the type of profile to add: <span class="span_2">Leisure, Corporate, Vendor, Agent, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Other</span>. </p>
            <p>(<span>Note: </span>Any of these types can be changed by clicking on the drop-down <span class="span_2">Type</span> in the Profile creation screen. This is also how to create a <span class="span_2">Service Provider </span>profile.) </p>
            <p>The second way to add a new profile is to click the <span class="span_2">Profile</span> icon on the toolbar.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_14.jpg" style="height: 221px;width: 251px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Profile%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Profiles.11.1.16.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>After clicking the Profile icon, a submenu appears to select the type of profile to add: <span class="span_2">Leisure, Corporate, Vendor, Agent, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Other</span>.</p>
            <p>The third way to create a new profile is to click <span>File|New</span> to select the type of profile - <span class="span_2">Leisure, Corporate, Vendor, Agent, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Other.</span> To create a service provider profile, select any profile type and inside the new profile screen, select service provider from the drop-down list by <span class="span_2">Profile Type. </span></p>
            <p>When entering a brand-new profile screen, notice that it is a Quick Entry Form:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_15.jpg" style="height: 455px;width: 594px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Profile%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Profiles.11.1.17.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>The Quick Entry form consists of two screens: one for the Profile and one for the Primary Traveler.</p>
            <h3><a name="Profile_Screen" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Profile Screen</h3>
            <p>All Required and Optional fields are displayed, along with basic fields: Profile Type, Name and Address fields, Primary Phone, Interface ID, Primary Agent, and Branch.</p>
            <p>(Set Required fields at <b>Global Defaults | General Setup | Required Fields |&#160;Profile Fields</b>.)</p>
            <p>From <span class="span_2">Type, </span>selected the correct profile type from the drop-down. By using the tab key, enter data. Notice all <span class="span_2">Required or Optional </span>fields are displayed on the right. (Required fields are indicated by a red asterisk.) As required or optional fields are entered, they will disappear from the display. </p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>Because so many agencies set Primary Phone to required and use it to automatically populate the Interface ID field, if Primary Phone and/or Primary Phone Description are set to required, those fields MUST be completed at the Profile level on the Quick Entry form before moving on to the Primary Traveler screen. </p>
            <p>Click <span class="span_2">Next </span>to continue.</p>
            <h3><a name="Primary_Traveler_Screen" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Primary Traveler Screen</h3>

            </p>
            <p>The next entry area is for the Primary Traveler. Fill in any data that applies. Click <span>OK</span> to save data and enter the profile. (A search is performed behind the scenes based on the name fields and the phone and email fields. If a match is found, the user is prompted with a list of the matching Travelers and is given the opportunity to either link the existing Traveler to the new profile, or to cancel out and create a new Traveler. If a user does not have permission to access a certain profile type, they will be unable to create profiles of that type. If a user has no permission to view a profile tab which has required fields for a certain profile type, the user will not be able to create a profile of that type.)</p>
            <p>Entering information for anyone who contacts the agency is essential, particularly the address and communication methods such as phone, cell phone, etc. At the very least, the agent should complete the communication information.</p>
            <p>See chapter, <span>An In-Depth Look at a Client Profiles</span>, for how to enter other client profile details.</p>

            <p>If you have entered a leisure profile incorrectly as a corporate one, or a corporate profile incorrectly as a leisure one, change the profile type so you don’t have to re-enter it all over again.

It’s that easy.</p>&#160;<h2><a name="Modifying_Client_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Modifying Client Profiles</h2><p>Each time a customer contacts the agency and there is an existing client profile in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>, agents need to check pertinent client information - such as current address and phone numbers - for accuracy. Here is a suggested routine:</p><p>1) Locate the client’s profile by doing a profile Query using Level 1, 2 or 3 Query filters as described in the <span class="span_2">Querying Your Profiles</span> section above.</p><p>2) Enter the client’s profile, by either double-clicking the highlighted entry in the results screen; or highlighting the desired entry and clicking the <span class="span_2">Go To</span> icon on the toolbar. </p><p>3) Check phone and address information and make any changes. When any change is made to the profile, the screen turns turquoise. </p><p>4) At this point, click <span class="span_2">OK</span> to save data and leave the profile; click <span class="span_2">Apply</span> to stay in the profile; or click <span class="span_2">Cancel</span> to abort.</p><h2><a name="Link_a_Traveler_Contact_to_Profile_from_Profile_Manager_Query" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor28"></a>Link a Traveler/Contact to Profile from Profile Manager Query</h2><p>Link a Traveler/Contact to an existing profile from the results of a Profile Manager Query. If a Traveler/Contact field is displayed in columns, when a user right-clicks on a record, the option "Link" is displayed in the menu. When selected, a Profile Query box opens, and the user can search for the profile they want to link the Traveler to. When the results of the query are displayed, user can select a profile to link to, cancel out, or enter different search terms and query again. </p><p><img src="resources/images/chapter 7 using the profile manager to manage your profiles/using the profile manager_17.jpg" style="height: 420px;width: 578px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Using%20Profile%20Mgr%20to%20Manage%20Profiles.11.1.19.jpg" class="img_1" /></p><p>&#160;</p></div>
