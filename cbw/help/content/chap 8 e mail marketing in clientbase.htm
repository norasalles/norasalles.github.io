            <p><span class="span_2">This section demonstrates how to setup and use Merge to E-mail in </span><span class="span_2">ClientBase to market to clients. It further outlines how to track mailings, and run follow-up reports.</span>
            </p>
            <h2><a name="Introduction_..86" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There are two e-mail options available for using <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> Merge to E-mail feature: <span>MAPI </span>(Messaging Application Protocol Interface) and <span>SMTP</span> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). <span>MAPI </span>requires use with compatible e-mail programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Express, Netscape and Eudora. E-mails sent with this option can be formatted in one of two modes - <span class="span_2">Plain Text </span>or<span class="span_2"> Document Template</span>. Setting the mode to document template allows you to insert merge fields into the body of a message, or select from a list of global default document templates.</p>
            <p>The <span>SMTP</span> option offers 2 benefits: It does <span class="span_3">not</span> require a MAPI compatible e-mail program for the Merge to E-mail feature to work, and with this option, you can use extensive text formatting, even using HTML, as well as using document templates within e-mail messages.</p>
            <p>The option for using either MAPI or SMTP as your method for sending e-mails is located within each user login. Upon installation of <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> (or update), all user logins continue to default to MAPI as the method, and each user login record needs to be modified to change the option to SMTP, if desired, and to capture the necessary e-mail settings. Initial setup also includes adjusting or checking e-mail settings at the workstation level because these override the user level defaults.</p>
            <p>Users can create e-mail signatures for use with the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> <span class="span_2">Merge to E-mail</span> feature. A global set of e-mail signatures can be created using formatted text, user login and agent merge fields and graphics. Each user login can link to one of these global e-mail signatures to set as that user’s default signature. Upon launching <span class="span_2">Merge to E-mail</span>, the system automatically launches the current user’s default signature or an e-mail signature can be selected at that time.</p>
            <h2><a name="Set_Up_E-mail_Signatures" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor328"></a>Set Up E-mail Signatures</h2>
            <p>This option only works if e-mails are set up as SMTP. Go to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|E-mail Signatures</span> and click <span class="span_2">Add.</span></p>

            </p>
            <p>Enter a brief description for the signature. Next, create an e-mail signature using formatted text and merge fields. If desired, use the blue and yellow button (with a picture of a person) to insert a graphic file. Click <span class="span_2">OK </span>to save and repeat these steps to create multiple e-mail signatures.</p>
            <p>Upon creating your global e-mail signatures, have each user go to <span>Utilities|My Login</span> and click the E-mail settings tab to select a default e-mail signature for each User.</p>

            <h2><a name="Set_Up_for_MAPI_E-mail" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor329"></a>Set Up for MAPI E-mail</h2>
            <p>Some sample MAPI compatible e-mail programs include Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Express, Netscape, and Eudora. To learn if your e-mail program is MAPI compatible, we recommend you visit the website of your e-mail provider and search for information on MAPI compatibility. When you install the <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> program, MAPI is the option which is defaulted in the user logins. </p>
            <h3><a name="Set_Up_ClientBase_with_MAPI_Settings" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Set Up ClientBase with MAPI Settings</h3>
            <p><span>Step 1: </span>To obtain a list of all user login records, log into the database as SYSDBA (System Database Administrator). Go to <span>Utilities| Users Logins|User List</span>.</p>
            <p>(<span class="span_2">Please note:</span> Users can access and setup their own login e-mail settings in addition to SYSDBA login by going to <span>Utilities|My Login</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Step 2: </span>Highlight each user login, click <span class="span_2">Modify</span>|<span class="span_2">E-mail Settings</span>. The <span class="span_2">Default E-mail Client </span>is <span class="span_2">MAPI. </span>If you select <span class="span_2">Outlook/MAPI Client</span> under<span class="span_2">, </span>the system will first try to send e-mail via Outlook and if doesn't exist then it will resort to MAPI. This will put any e-mails sent through <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> in the Sent Box of Outlook. </p>
            <p>If you have set up a customized e-mail signature, select from the <span class="span_2">Default Signature </span>drop-down. No further setup is required. </p>

            <p>The first step in using the Merge to E-mail feature is to use the Profile Manager to find the profile(s) to <span class="span_2">Merge to E-mail</span> by using Level 1, 2, or 3 Query. E-mail addresses are kept in the communication entry table found in the general information tab of all types of profiles. </p>
            <p>When merging information into an e-mail, merge the information to e-mail from the results screen:</p>
            <p>1) Click the toolbar e-mail icon or select the menu item <span>Merge To|E-mail</span>, or;</p>
            <p>2) Double-click a profile to enter the profile folder. From within the profile, click the toolbar E-mail icon. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 8 email marketing in clientbase/e mail marketing in clientbase_4.jpg" style="height: 291px;width: 579px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/E-Mail%20Marketing%20in%20CB.12.1.05.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p><span>Sort by:</span> Choose how e-mails are sorted. Choices include <span class="span_2">Name, First Name, Last Name, </span>and<span class="span_2"> E-mail </span>(default).</p>
            <p><span>Include Records:</span> Select <span class="span_2">Current Results in Profile Manager </span>(one e-mail is created for all profiles included in the results screen); or <span class="span_2">Selected Results in Profile Manager </span>(only those profiles that have been selected from results screen by holding down CTRL key and selecting and/or by right-mouse clicking results screen to <span class="span_2">Invert All, Select All </span>or<span class="span_2"> Unselect All</span>).</p>
            <p><span>Look for E-mails In:</span> <span class="span_2">Profile (If none, then Primary Traveler) -</span> This option sends to the profile-level e-mail address, if there is one. If there isn't, then it will use the e-mail address of the primary traveler. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Traveler (If none, then Profile) -</span> If no traveler has an e-mail address that meets the query criteria, then e-mail is sent to the profile address or addresses that meet the criteria. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Traveler Only</span> - Looks only for traveler e-mail addresses based on matching query criteria. This option merges to all traveler e-mail addresses that meet the criteria. If there isn't one, then nothing is sent. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">All (Profile and Traveler)</span> - this option sends to all addresses in the profile that meet the query criteria. </p>
            <p><span>Include Only E-mails With Marketing Permission Checked:</span> By default this is unchecked to include only e-mails with marketing permission.</p>
            <p><span>Include Only Primary E-mail:</span> this box is checked by default. For any of the above options, if this box is checked, only the Primary E-mail address (either traveler, profile, or both, depending on the option chosen) will be sent to. If it's unchecked, then all e-mails, primary or non-primary, that meet the criteria will be used.</p>
            <p><span>Use BCC Method of Sending E-mail: </span>For users who want to send one e-mail with all other recipients as <span class="span_2">Blind Carbon Copies</span>. This avoids having to delete many e-mails out of your <span class="span_2">Sent Box</span> for MAPI users<span class="span_2">. </span>It is a good idea to input your own e-mail address in the <span class="span_2">To</span> field as anti-Spam programs need to see at least one e-mail address. <span>Suggestion: </span>Don’t use this option.</p>

            <p><span>Step 1: </span>To obtain a list of all user login records, log into the database as SYSDBA (System Database Administrator). Go to <span>Utilities| Users Logins|User List</span>.</p>
            <p>(<span class="span_2">Please note:</span> Users can access and setup their own login e-mail settings in addition to SYSDBA login by going to <span>Utilities|My Login</span>.</p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Step 3:</span> Complete the <span class="span_2">User Login SMTP Settings </span>obtained from the entity responsible for maintaining your mail server:</p>
            <p><span>Default E-mail Client: </span>Choose SMTP off the drop-down menu. </p>
            <p><span>Default SMTP Mode:</span> Offers different options for creating the body of the e-mail message. Select either <span class="span_2">Formatted Text, Document Templates, Raw HTML </span>or<span class="span_2"> Plain Text</span> from the drop-down list. This setting determines the default <span class="span_2">Mode</span> when using the <span class="span_2">Merge to E-mail</span> feature, but can be changed when sending an e-mail. </p>
            <p><span>From E-mail Address:</span> Enter the e-mail address for the user login you are setting up. The address entered here appears as the from address for all e-mails sent from this user. If you wish to change this address frequently, do so at the e-mail level when you are sending it out.</p>
            <p>In the <span class="span_2">From e-mail</span> field, if you type <span>joyce@abctravel.com</span> and a message is sent, you see the From field saying <span>joyce@abctravel.com</span>. Some people prefer it to look like this instead, <span>Joyce Smith</span>. To have it appear like this, type <span>Joyce Smith&lt;joyce@abctravel.com&gt;</span> instead of just <span>joyce@abctravel.com</span>. You can also use your company name or department name; for example, <span>Travel With the Stars&lt;sales@TWTS.com&gt; </span>or <span>Star Travel Marketing&lt;sales@TWTS.com&gt;.</span></p>
            <p><span>Outgoing Mail Server:</span> Enter the outgoing mail server name determined in your steps above. Examples: mail.domainname.com, smtp.domainname.com, or gomail.wspan.com).</p>
            <p><span>Port: </span>This setting defines the TCP/IP port which your e-mail application listens on for incoming mail. If left blank, this setting uses port 25 by default, which is the Internet standard for receiving SMTP mail. In some situations, you may have chosen to move the SMTP service to another port. Perhaps you already have a service on port 25, and you do not want the services to conflict over the port assignment. In such a case, enter the port <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> should use. </p>
            <p><span>Authentication Type:</span> This setting is used to authenticate your connection to the SMTP mail server by forcing a USER name and password. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Default:</span> If the network login does not handle this authentication automatically, then set this field to <span class="span_2">Default.</span></p>
            <p><span class="span_2">None</span><span>:</span> If your agency is hosting your own e-mail server and the network login has been configured to handle the authentication to the SMTP Server automatically, set this field to <span class="span_2">None. </span></p>
            <p><span>E-mail Account Login and Password:</span> Use when <span class="span_2">Login Type</span> is set to <span class="span_2">Default. </span>Enter your e-mail account login and password here.</p>
            <p><span>Secured Connections: </span>If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) supports SSL/TLS secure connections, there are four options available on the drop down: <span class="span_2">None, TLS (if available), TLS, and SSL</span>. The type of connection you select is determined by the type of security supported by your e-mail provider or Internet Service Provider (ISP). Please contact your ISP to find out which setting is correct for your e-mail account. </p>
            <p class="p_2">SSL: Use SSL for encrypting e-mail sent via SMTP.</p>
            <p class="p_2">TLS: Use TLS for encrypting e-mail sent via SMTP. </p>
            <p class="p_2">TLS, if available: Attempt to use TLS for encrypting e-mail sent via SMTP. If the server does not support TLS, SSL will be attempted instead.</p>
            <p class="p_2">None: You do not wish to encrypt your e-mail(s) or you SMTP server does not support SSL/TLS.</p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> TLS (Transport Layer Security) is quickly becoming the common standard for encrypting e-mails. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor to TLS. There are very few differences between SSL and TLS. TLS's encryption is a little stronger, however both types are almost identical, with only minor technical differences in the way the e-mail is encrypted and transmitted.</p>
            <p>The default port for encrypted connections is 465 and unencrypted is 25. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> will automatically set the port to these defaults when choosing a Secure Connection setting. Note: Port 587 is also commonly used by many servers for encrypted connections. </p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> that in order for Secure Connection: TLS/SSL to work with SMTP E-mail settings in <span class="span_2">ClientBase Windows</span>, you must install the 3rd party Win32 OpenSSL.</p>
            <p>You can search for "win openssl" in your browser or click here to get to files:</p>

            <p>The first step in using the Merge to E-mail feature is to use the Profile Manager to find the profile(s) to <span class="span_2">Merge to E-mail</span> by using Level 1, 2, or 3 Query. E-mail addresses are kept in the communication entry table found in the general information tab of all types of profiles. </p>
            <p>When merging information into an e-mail, merge the information to e-mail from the results screen:</p>
            <p>1) Click the toolbar e-mail icon or select the menu item <span>Merge To|E-mail</span>, or;</p>
            <p>2) Double-click a profile to enter the profile folder. From within the profile, click the toolbar e-mail icon. </p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Sort by:</span> Choose how e-mails are sorted. Choices include <span class="span_2">Name, First Name, Last Name, </span>and<span class="span_2"> E-mail </span>(default).</p>
            <p><span>Include Records:</span> Select <span class="span_2">Current Results in Profile Manager </span>(one e-mail is created for all profiles included in the results screen); or <span class="span_2">Selected Results in Profile Manager </span>(only those profiles that have been selected from results screen by holding down CTRL key and selecting and/or by right-mouse clicking results screen to <span class="span_2">Invert All, Select All </span>or<span class="span_2"> Unselect All</span>).</p>
            <p><span>Look for E-mails In:</span> Select <span class="span_2">Primary (if none, then Primary Traveler), Traveler (if none, then Profile), Traveler Only, All (Profile and Traveler).</span></p>
            <p><span>Include Only E-mails With Marketing Permission Checked:</span> By default this is unchecked to include only e-mails with marketing permission.</p>
            <p><span>Include Only Primary E-mail: </span>This gives the user the ability to exclude e-mail addresses marked as invalid when merging e-mails from the results of a Query.</p>
            <p><span>Use BCC Method of Sending E-mail: </span>For users who want to send one e-mail with all other recipients as <span class="span_2">Blind Carbon Copies</span>. This avoids having to delete many e-mails out of your <span class="span_2">Sent Box</span> for MAPI users<span class="span_2">. </span>It is a good idea to input your own e-mail address in the <span class="span_2">To</span> field as anti-Spam programs need to see at least one e-mail address. <span>Suggestion: </span>Don’t use this option.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For each e-mail being sent, notice the <span class="span_2">Profile Name, Address, Phone </span>and <span class="span_2">Fax Numbers. </span>To get to other e-mails in the series, use the navigation arrows. </p>
            <p><span>Subject:</span> Type the subject of the e-mail.</p>
            <p><span>Priority:</span> Select a priority label from the drop-down menu of <span class="span_2">Highest, High, Normal, Low </span>and<span class="span_2"> Lowest</span>.</p>
            <p><span>Mode:</span> Select how you want to format the body of your message. Choices include:</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Formatted Text:</span> Free-flow your message by typing the text and using the toolbar to format it as desired. Please note if hyperlinks are included within the message, highlight the link and click the hyperlink icon on the toolbar to format it properly.</p>

            <p><span class="span_4">Raw HTML</span>: Paste RAW HTML into the body of the message. <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> does not come with an HTML editor, so use a tool such as <span class="span_2">Front Page</span> or <span class="span_2">Dreamweaver</span> to create HTML, or right-click on any HTML page, <span class="span_2">View Source</span> and copy the contents to clipboard and then paste into the RAW HTML tab. Please see section below on sending out pre-formatted HTML marketing pieces.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Plain Text</span>: Enter e-mail message without any formatting. This message can then be viewed by e-mail recipients, regardless of their e-mail service.</p>
            <p><span class="span_4">Preview</span> is available for all e-mail modes and allows you to preview message in its formatted state before sending.

            <p>Font settings: Select the font, size, color and background color from the drop-downs provided.</p>
            <p><span>Greeting/Merge Fields:</span> Type the greeting of the e-mail, and from the drop-down menu, choose the field - <span class="span_2">First Name, Full Name, Courtesy Title Last Name, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Salutation </span>to merge to the e-mail. <br /><br /><span>Tip:</span> If you select <span>Salutation|Courtesy Title Last Name</span><span>,</span> <span>Salutation|First Name</span>, or <span>Salutation|Name </span>as a merge field, the | character included in the Salutation means that if the Salutation field is not completed within one of the resulting profiles, then for just that profile, you want it to use the merge field following the |.</p>
            <p><span>Using Spell Check:</span> Several dictionaries have automatically been installed onto each workstation running <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> providing you with the ability to identify misspellings within Document Templates. By default, while typing within any of these three areas, the spell check feature automatically underlines each misspelled word. Right-click on a misspelled word and you will be offered suggested spellings along with the ability to <span class="span_2">Ignore, Ignore All </span>or<span class="span_2"> Add</span> to Dictionary. In addition a Spell Check button, labeled <span class="span_2">ABC</span> has been added to the toolbar of the e-mail allowing you to run the spell check routine across all data captured.</p>
            <p><span>Signature Tab:</span> Click the Signature tab to view the default e-mail signature based on the current login and setup established in <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|E-mail Signatures</span>. Override the default signature or enter a unique signature directly from this tab if desired.

            <p>4. Hit PREVIEW to view message. If the border is distorted upon viewing, this means there is too much text. Edit the message and press <span class="span_2">Preview</span> again until the border is intact. When satisfied with the look, click <span class="span_2">Display Postcard</span>. </p>
            <p>5. In the Profile Manager, Query the desired clients that match this marketing need, and select <span class="span_2">Merge to Mail</span>.</p>
            <p>6. Set the e-mail mode to <span class="span_2">Raw HTML,</span> then click <span class="span_2">Copy from Manager</span> to copy the e-marketing piece from the Internet Manager to the e-mail message. </p>
            <p>7. Preview and send to customer(s). </p>
            <p><span>Hint:</span> If you want merged fields, it is much easier to first create a document template in <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span>. Go to <span>Global Defaults|General Setup|Document Template, </span>click <span>File|New</span> to create a basic template. Here’s an example:</p>
            <p class="p_3">Hi «First Name»,</p>
            <p class="p_3">Enter text</p>
            <p class="p_3">Regards,</p>
            <p class="p_3">«Primary Agent»</p>
            <p class="p_3">Save the template (File/Save as) AiPlus</p>
            <p>Now that you have a template, next time you launch the desired post card, go to <span>Global Defaults|Document Template|General Setup|Load AiPlus</span>, highlight and copy /paste merge fields into the AiPlus postcard in the internet manager.</p>
            <h2><a name="Track_E-mail_Broadcast_Results" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Track E-mail Broadcast Results</h2>
            <p>Tracking the success of your marketing efforts is important. The results from an e-mail broadcast may come in the form of an actual booking for the product you promoted, as an inquiry, or as a booking of another product. It is essential that to setup good tracking in the form of <span class="span_2">Mailers</span> within <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> so that you can determine what vendors and marketing pieces get the most results.</p>
            <p><span>Example: </span>Agent Sharon sends out a Princess Alaska HTML e-mail broadcast to all clients interested in cruising and Alaska by doing a Level 2 Query from the client profile marketing tab. Before sending out the e-mail, Sharon clicks <span class="span_2">Mailer</span> so the system can automatically create a record of this e-mail broadcast within each of the clients’ profiles. (After every e-mail blast for SMTP, you are also prompted <span class="span_2">"Create a Mailer?" </span>before you leave the Merge to E-mail feature.) </p>
            <p>When Sharon’s clients start replying to the mailer, Sharon keeps track of this by Querying up the <span class="span_2">Mailer</span> and entering a <span class="span_2">Response Date. </span>Because Sharon has created a <span class="span_2">Mailer</span>, she can follow up in a few weeks to see what kind of results she’s gotten from the e-mail broadcast.</p>
            <h2><a name="Reports_on_E-mail_Marketing_Results" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor334"></a>Reports on E-mail Marketing Results</h2>
            <p>The best part of doing e-mail marketing (outside of getting an actual booking) is using <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> to measure how successful the e-mail broadcasts are. It is essential that you create <span class="span_2">Mailers</span> within <span class="span_2">ClientBase</span> each time you sent out e-mails. Analyze your success by running queries or reports to see the bookings or activity of only those people who received a particular e-mail. To do this you need to know the name of the <span class="span_2">Mailer</span> you created for a particular promotion.</p>
            <h3><a name="E-mail_Broadcast_Booking_Direct_Results_Report" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>E-mail Broadcast Booking Direct Results Report</h3>
            <p>To find how many bookings you received as a result of an e-mail broadcast, run the following Query and/or report that uses both the Res Cards and the invoices from travel history (in case your office does not use Res Cards for every reservation):</p>
            <p>1) Open Level 3 Query and click <span class="span_2">Reset All</span>.</p>
            <p>2) Click <span class="span_2">Add Filter, </span>and go to the <span class="span_2">Activities </span>tab. In the <span class="span_2">Subject</span> box, select <span class="span_2">Is Equal to</span>. Then use the drop-down arrow to select the mailer promotion. Next, go to the <span class="span_2">ResCards</span> tab and in <span class="span_2">Create Date, </span>choose <span class="span_2">Is From</span>, and type in a date using the date that you originally sent the e-mail broadcast, and in <span class="span_2">To</span>, type today's current date. Press <span class="span_2">OK</span>.</p>
            <p>3) Click <span class="span_2">Add Filter </span>and go to the <span class="span_2">Activities</span> tab. In the <span class="span_2">Subject</span> box, select <span class="span_2">Is Equal to</span>. Then use the drop-down arrow to select the mailer promotion. Next, go to the <span class="span_2">Travel History</span> tab and in the <span class="span_2">Invoice Issue Date,</span> choose <span class="span_2">Is From</span>. Type in a date using the date that you originally sent the e-mail broadcast, and in <span class="span_2">TO</span>, type today's current date. Press <span class="span_2">OK.</span></p>
            <p>4) Now you should have two filters in the Query window. Click <span class="span_2">Refresh</span>. </p>
            <p>All of the clients in this Query have received the promotional e-mail, and booked something from your office after they received the e-mail. You may also have some people who called and the agent created an Res Card that is <span class="span_2">Under Consideration. </span>This means success! Now granted, it's possible that the client booked a different product other than what you were promoting. You'll need to open up their profiles and take a look at the Res Cards or travel history to see what they've booked.</p>
            <h3><a name="E-mail_Broadcast_Multiple_Vendor_Report_Using_Res_Cards" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>E-mail Broadcast Multiple Vendor Report Using Res Cards </h3>
            <p>This is a comprehensive e-mail broadcast report based on the Res Cards alone, which you can use to judge if an e-mail broadcast increased the production for the vendor or possibly gave business to some of their competitors. (If you create reservations outside of the Res Cards, use <span class="span_2">Trams Back Office</span> to pull vendor production reports.) </p>
            <p>This multiple vendor report details all vendor production for a specific time period:</p>
            <p>1) Open the <span class="span_2">Res Cards Manager, </span>and do a Level 2 Query. Click <span class="span_2">Filter</span> and then <span class="span_2">Reset</span>.</p>
            <p>2) In <span class="span_2">Create Date, </span>type in the <span class="span_2">FROM </span>field the date that you originally sent the e-mail broadcast, and in <span class="span_2">TO</span>, type in today's current date. Click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. </p>
            <p>3) Go to <span>Reports|Res Card Reports|Vendor Booking Report</span>. Select <span class="span_2">Current Results in ResCard Manager</span>, and click <span class="span_2">OK</span>.</p>
            <p>4) Analyze this report and see if the production increased for a specific vendor as a result of the e-mail broadcast. Pull this report for different date periods before the broadcast to get an idea of your "normal" production versus an "after the e-mail broadcast" time period. </p>
            <p>Finally compare the client names in the multiple vendors report to the clients that showed up in the direct results report, and you have the exact revenue earned from your marketing efforts!</p>

            <p>If you have been conscientiously entering the <span class="span_2">Response Date</span> in the <span class="span_2">Mailer</span> when clients are calling in about a marketing e-mail they received, you can print out a report to determine how many people have replied:</p>
            <p>1) Open Level 2 Query and click<span class="span_2"> Filter, </span>and the <span class="span_2">Reset. </span></p>
            <p>2) Go to the <span class="span_2">Activities </span>tab and check <span class="span_2">Mailer. </span>From the drop-down <span class="span_2">Completed/Responded </span>menu, select <span class="span_2">Completed/Responded, </span>and in the <span class="span_2">Date</span> From Field, enter the date of the promotion, and in the <span class="span_2">To </span>Field, enter today’s date. </p>

            <p>All of the clients in this Query have responded to the promotional e-mail. If you have kept a record of how many e-mail you sent, you can get a percentage of how many people responded to the e-mail to determine if the e-mail marketing campaign was successful.</p>
