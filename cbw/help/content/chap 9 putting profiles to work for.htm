            <p class="p_2">This section demonstrates how to use the powerful ClientBase features, Merge to Doc, Merge to E-mail, Merge to File, Merge to Print, Merge to Label, and Merge to PNR.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Black';font-size: 18pt;color: #c00000;">Introduction</p>
            <p>Your agency has built a valuable database by consistently collecting and recording client data. Now it is time to put that data to work for you. Save valuable time by merging client profile data into PNR's, labels, document templates, e-mails, and files. Merge reminders, notes or mailers with multiple profiles for another great time saver. By using the stored data in the profiles instead of manually typing client information each time, you not only cut work time, but also reduce the chances of typing errors. </p>
            <h2><a name="Merge_to_Labels" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor127"></a>Merge to Labels </h2>
            <p>ClientBase puts the entire marketing process at your fingertips with the ability to easily print mailing labels from your database. Print a single label while working within a client profile, or print numerous labels from the results of any of the manager's Level 1, 2, or 3 queries. ClientBase queries provide you with a powerful marketing tool by giving you the ability to search your database using any one or any combination of client fields as search criteria. ClientBase makes mailings easy and efficient. </p>
            <p><span>Important Note</span>: Before you use the Merge to Label feature, please refer to chapter entitled,<span class="span_2"> Setting Up ClientBase for Your Agency</span> to learn how to setup labels and envelopes. </p>

            </p>
            <p>The first step in using the Merge to Label feature in ClientBase is to use the Profile Manager to find the profile(s) included in the merge. When merging information into a label format, you have several choices. You can merge the information to labels from the results screen by: </p>
            <p>1) Highlighting the desired profile and clicking the toolbar label icon, or on the menu item <span>Merge To|Labels</span>. </p>
            <p>2) From within the profile, accessing the same toolbar Label icon. </p>
            <p>3) Querying a group of profiles and clicking the Label toolbar icon or clicking <span>Merge to|Labels</span>. </p>
            <p>4) From a group of profiles, selecting consecutive or non-consecutive profiles by holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key. (See section, How to Multi-Select Records below.) Use also the edit menu or right-mouse click in results screen to Invert All, Select All, or Unselect All in the results screen. Then click the toolbar label icon or go to <span>Merge To|Label</span>. When you click the toolbar label icon, a label dialog box appears: </p>

            </p>
            <p>From here, Include Records from Current Results in Profile Manager, Selected Results in Profile Manager, or Re-Query Profile Manager. By default there is a check by Include Only Addresses with Marketing Permission Check. A label preview screen appears containing a menu bar: </p>

The disk icon allows you to save this to a location on your computer. You can also e-mail this label report by clicking on the E-mail icon. </p>
            <p><span>Label Setup:</span> The label icon with the green wrench is the label setup, so that you can reformat labels for this particular printing only. Want to reuse a label sheet?

Clicking this icon automatically creates a mailer record for every customer included in your results. Whether it's one result or 500 results, a unique mailer record is attached to each profile for historical purposes. Mailers are viewed from within the client profile in the activities tab, or can be queried and printed from the Activities Manager by date or subject. </p>

            <p>Sending personalized letters frequently helps build stronger relationships with clients. That's one of the things that ClientBase does best. Document templates come with the program making it easy to print personalized letters for your customers. You can build a library of documents by adding your own customized templates for access by all agents. The speed and ease of this feature gives agents reason to be more pro-active in their communication with customers, thus building customer loyalty. </p>
            <p><span>Important Note:</span> Before you use the Merge to Document Templates feature, please refer to chapter entitled, <span class="span_2">Setting Up ClientBase for Your Agency</span> to learn how to setup the default templates. </p>

            <p>The first step in using the Merge to Document Templates feature is to use the Profile Manager to find the profile(s) to merge with the document template. When merging information into a document template, you have several choices. Merge the information to a document template from the results screen by:</p>
            <p>1) Highlighting the desired profile and clicking the toolbar letter icon or on the menu item Merge To|Document Templates. </p>
            <p>2) From within the profile, accessing the same toolbar Letter icon. </p>
            <p>3) Querying a group of profiles and clicking the Letter toolbar icon or <span>Merge To|Document</span> <span>Templates</span>. </p>
            <p>4) From the group of profiles, selecting consecutive or non-consecutive profiles by holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key. Use also the edit menu or right-mouse click in results screen to Invert All, Select All or Unselect All. (See section, How to Multi-Select Records below.) Click the toolbar Letter Icon or <span>Merge To|Document Templates</span>. </p>
            <p>When you click the toolbar letter icon, a letter dialog box appears: </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 9 putting profiles to work for you/putting profiles to work for_6.jpg" style="height: 293px;width: 414px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Putting%20Your%20Profiles%20to%20Work%20for%20You.13.1.07.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>Browse for different templates and preview the document template you want to use, by using the drop-down menu. After selecting the document template, either I<span class="span_2">nclude Records from Current Results in Profile Manager, Selected Results in Profile Manager, </span>or<span class="span_2"> Re-Query Profile Manager</span> and click <span class="span_2">OK</span>. By default Include Only Addresses with Marketing Permission Checked are selected.</p>
            <p>Based on the selected template, a set of letters is merged with information from each client's profile on the list. A toolbar enables you to edit documents within the Query. A document Indicator tells you what document number you are in, and how many documents have been generated.</p>
            <p>Click the right and left arrows to navigate through the documents. To preview the documents you are sending out, click the Preview icon. </p>

            </p>
            <p>To make changes to just one of the documents, arrow to that document and make the desired changes from within the Document Tab. To make changes to all of the documents, click the Template Tab, make changes and then click Update. This updates all of the documents included in this particular Query, but does not permanently change the global template. Notice that other options on the template toolbar allow you to change the text color, alignment, style, size or even font. You can add content in the header or footer of the document. There is also Insert Field to place the contents of other profile fields into the letter. When you finish making all changes, click <span class="span_2">Update Document. </span></p>

            <p><span>Dictionaries:</span> Several different language dictionaries have automatically been installed, although by default only the General English dictionary has been enabled. From this area, Add, Enable, Disable or Remove dictionaries. Note: All dictionaries have been installed within the My Documents\TRAMS\Dictionary directory. </p>
            <p><span>User Dictionaries:</span> A blank user dictionary is also automatically installed where you can customize the dictionaries used when running spell check to include words not currently in the General Dictionaries.

            <h2><a name="Merge_to_PNR" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor129"></a>Merge to PNR </h2>
            <p>No more multiple entries or databases! ClientBase provides agents with the ability to move customer information (maintained in ClientBase profiles) to your reservation system's PNR. Sit back and watch the marketing database grow as agents become more efficient in collecting and using the database information to build PNR's. You'll be surprised at how quickly existing customer information gets updated, and how quickly new customer information gets added to your marketing database, when agents use ClientBase as the source for building PNR's. Also, watch customer loyalty grow as agents quickly access customer information instead of asking for the same information over and over again. </p>
            <p>Any field captured in a client profile can be formatted for your GDS PNR. In addition to client profile fields, ClientBase includes four PNR entry tables-at the branch level, at the agent level, at the profile level and at the traveler level. This means you have complete flexibility on the amount of information you would like automatically formatted for a PNR while working in a ClientBase profile. </p>
            <p><span>Important Note</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> **Before you use the Merge to PNR feature, please refer to chapter entitled, <span class="span_2">Setting Up ClientBase for Your Agency </span>to learn how to setup Merge to PNR, Merge to PNR Entries, and Merge to PNR Rules. </p>

            <p>The first step in using the Merge to PNR feature is to locate the profile you want to merge with your CRS from any of your 3 main Managers, include Profile Manager, Activity Manager and Res Card Manager. When merging information into your CRS, you have several choices. Merge the information to PNR from the Query results screen by: </p>
            <p>1) Highlighting the desired profile and clicking the toolbar CRS/PNR icon or clicking the menu item <span>Merge To|PNR</span>, or; </p>
            <p>2) Double-clicking the desired profile to enter the profile folder. From within the profile, access the same toolbar CRS/PNR icon to start the move to PNR. </p>
            <p>(The first time you do a Merge to PNR, change the Reservation System to yours. It'll save this next time you come in.) After you have clicked on the Merge to PNR icon in the toolbar, notice a series of check boxes in the PNR builder selection screen.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Select the information you want to move to a PNR by checking any optional entries. There are two entries tabs in this screen. The additional entries tab allows you to check off hidden profile, traveler, branch or agent entries. These additional entries are not displayed on the front screen but can automatically move to every PNR if you have created them with the Always Move this Entry option. By only displaying the entries on the PNR entry screen that you want to review, the process is simplified for ease of reviewing. In the Traveler Entries column, these should appear in alphabetical order for commercial clients and in the order they were created for leisure clients. If you want to change the order in the PNR, however, simply use your mouse to drag the traveler into the desired position in the column. Click Send to PNR. (By clicking Preview, you are taken into a PNR preview screen.)</p>

                </p>
                <p> Amadeus has agreed to waive an fees associated with Plus Scripts for all Trams customers, so there is no cost, just a phone call to the support desk.</p>
                <p> Since Plus Scripts is unavailable with ProWeb the PNR features via API do not work, but it works via clipboard.</p>

The PNR Selection Screen is the screen that appears when you use the Merge to PNR feature and allows you to select the specific profile data to be included and sent to the current PNR. For PNR entries that should always move regardless of the profile or PNR, this Display on Selection Screen can be unchecked so that the Selection Screen is less complicated for the agent to review.

            <p>Use the results of a profile Query to Merge to File. This enables you to create an ASCII delimited or text (.txt) file which can be e-mailed to a location of your choice or put on a disk. This is particularly useful for agencies who use mailing houses for bulk mail or need to send their computer lists to consortia for special mailings. </p>
            <h3><a name="Using_the_Merge_to_File_Feature" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Using the Merge to File Feature </h3>
            <p>The first step in using the Merge to File feature is to use the Profile Manager to find the profile(s) you want to merge to the file. </p>
            <p>1) The first step in using the Merge to File feature is to search in the Profile, Activity, or Res Card Manager to find the list of records to be included in the ASCII export.</p>
            <p>2) Designate the fields to include within the file for each record in your results. The fields to include are based upon the current columns displayed within your Query results. To change the fields to include, use Select Columns to add or remove the fields within columns as desired.</p>
            <p>3) Designate the sort order to include within the file for each record. This sorting within the ASCII export is determined by the current sorting of the current Query results. To change the sorting, use Sort by Columns to setup to three levels of sorting criteria.</p>
            <p>4) Click <span>Merge|File </span>on the file menu items. A dialog box appears prompting you for the following information: </p>

            <p><span>File Name:</span> Click the three dots next to the File Name field and select to which folder or disk you want the file exported, and give it a file name. The file extension is .txt. </p>
            <p><span>Include Field Name: </span>This is checked by default and determines whether field headers describing the fields of data in each record are included in the file. </p>
            <p><span>ASCII File Type:</span> Select either <span class="span_2">Comma delimited </span>or<span class="span_2"> Tab delimited</span>. This character separates each field included within each record in the file. Tab delimited is usually the default for most imports.</p>

            <p>The File Handoff feature is a streamlined approach to creating and sending files to another entity, such as a mailing house or consortium for participation in a direct mail program. The Merge to File Handoff uses a wizard approach, walking you through setting up the ASCII file, keeping a history within the profiles included via a mailer record, and then sending the file via e-mail (or saving to disk). </p>
            <p>Before using the Merge to File Handoff, use the Level 1, 2 or 3 Query to Query your database for just those profiles you would like included in the ASCII file (.txt) created by this feature. Select the columns and sorts you will be using. Use also the edit menu or right-mouse click in results screen to Invert All, Select All or Unselect All. Next, click Merge To|File Handoff. The wizard guides you through the following steps: </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 9 putting profiles to work for you/putting profiles to work for_16.jpg" style="height: 370px;width: 447px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/CBW38/images/Putting%20Your%20Profiles%20to%20Work%20for%20You.13.1.17.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p><span>Step One: </span>A window appears to identify what profiles to include, what address information to include, and what Branch ID to include for any profiles that do not have a Branch ID. </p>
            <p><span class="span_2">Please note</span>, the Branch ID is mandatory to ensure that each profile from the database is associated with your agency or branch identification, in case the file is consolidated into a larger database of other agency profiles. The Branch ID can be entered here or by going into the Utilities Menu, selecting Branch, using Modify to enter the Branch record, and then completing the Branch ID field, located to the right of the Pseudo-City field. </p>
            <p><span>Step Two:</span> The file created by this process is hard-coded to include 7 Marketing Fields labeled with the field names of <span class="span_2">When, Where, With Whom, What Type, What Interest, What Budget and Client Status.</span> (The default subdelimiter is ^.)</p>
            <p>Map the marketing tables in the database to the appropriate marketing field in the file by clicking the down arrow next to each marketing field, and selecting from the drop-down list of marketing tables. If your agency does not maintain a marketing category for any of the 7 hard-coded marketing fields, then simply leave that field blank. </p>
            <p><span>Step Three:</span> Select the delivery method of <span class="span_2">Save to Disk, Outlook/MAPI E-mail (as an Attachment); SMTP E-Mail (as an Attachment) or MAPI E-mail as an Attachment</span>. If either MAPI or SMTP e-mail is selected, then an e-mail message appears, and the ASCII file is automatically attached.</p>

            </p>
            <p><span>Step Four</span>: Review a summary of the options selected so far in Steps 1 to 3. Use Previous to go back and make any changes. Use Mailer to create a mailer record for those profiles included in the file. Click <span class="span_2">Finish</span> to create the file and complete the handoff process.</p>
            <p><span>Step Five:</span> If Save to Disk was selected as the delivery method, then the file is saved to the location specified and the process is complete. If e-mail was selected as the delivery method, then an e-mail message appears with the summary screen displayed in Step Four included in the body of the message and the ASCII file (.txt) attached to the e-mail. Simply enter the e-mail address and click Send Current. </p>

            <p>To multi-select records from the results of a Query, use the &lt;CTRL&gt; key in combination with a mouse click. Notice one of three symbols next to each profile as you push &lt;CTRL&gt; and click it: </p>
            <p>a) <span>Bullet</span> - Profile has been selected. </p>
            <p>b) <span>Bullet and Bracket</span> - Profile has been selected and is the current profile record your cursor is focused on. </p>
            <p>c) <span>Solid Triangle</span> - Profile has NOT been selected as part of the multi-select, but is the current record your cursor is focused on. &lt;CTRL&gt; Click once to get the bullet and bracket, and a second time if you choose not to include in the multi-select after all. You can also use the main edit menu or right-mouse click in the results screen to Select All, Unselect All or Invert the results. </p>
            <p>Your agency has built a valuable database by consistently collecting and recording client data. Now it is time to put that data to work for you. Save valuable time by merging client profile data into PNR’s, document templates, labels, and files. Print out the results of queries for telemarketing or reference. By using the stored data in the profiles instead of manually typing client information each time, you not only cut work time, but also reduce the chances of typing errors. </p>
