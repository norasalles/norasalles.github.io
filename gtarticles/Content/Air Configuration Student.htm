The GetThere system identifies the airports requested for arrival/departure by the user as primary airport and any other airport options returned in the fight option will be identify as alternate airport.</p>
                                    <p>So, if the user is searching for JFK as arrival airport then the flight options with JFK as arrival airport will be primary airport and the flights options with EWR and/or LGA as arrival airport will be alternate airport.</p>
                                    <p>Similarly, if the user is searching for EWR as arrival airport then the flight options with EWR as arrival airport will be primary airport and the flights options with JFK and/or LGA as arrival airport will be alternate airport.</p>
                                    <p>

                                    </p>
                                    <p>The configuration of alternate airport is not the same as it is explained in the configuration section. So, follow below guidelines to configure alternate airport properly.</p>
                                    <p>Alternate airport configuration allows you to setup a default airport as per your choice and make other airport options restricted to display as itinerary option.</p>
                                    <p>The airport code entered in the city code box will be the default airport and the airport codes entered in the airport codes box will be treated as alternate airport and will be restricted to display as itinerary option.</p>
                                    <p>As per the above screenshot, JFK has been setup as default airport and EWR and LGA are the restricted alternate airport. In this way, if a user is searching for EWR and/or LGA as departure/arrival airport then the system will bring flight options with JFK only and show JFK with alternate airport icon.</p>

                                    <p>Custom Airline Notes creates a hyperlink (and if selected, an icon) that takes the user to detailed information about specific flights on the Select a Flight page. The hyperlink is applied to all flights that match the criteria specified and can include a custom message about a discount, negotiated amenity, other promotion, or convey messages to users concerning reasons to avoid certain flights. For example, you can configure Custom Airline Notes to warn travelers to avoid a specific airline that has repeated safety violations.</p>
