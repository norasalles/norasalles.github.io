            <p>To protect the security of the Trams Back Office system for the agency, each person using Trams Back Office is assigned a User Profile. Each User Profile in Trams Back Office is unique, authorizing different levels of access for each user. The user is prompted for a Login, and Password when launching the Trams Back Office program. Trams Back Office assumes there is one person who acts as a gatekeeper for access to all levels of Trams Back Office.  The “gatekeeper” limits who can get into the agency’s financial records, payroll information, or commission amounts. Assigning passwords and login names are the way to accomplish different levels of access.
</p>
            <p>We recommend that each person who uses Trams Back Office has a login with their own name, and that no one shares a login. This creates an “audit trail” and gives the agency manager the ability to ascertain who accessed the Trams database and what changes were made. 
</p>
            <h3><a name="User_Profile_Authorization_Levels_–_SYSDBA,_Manager_and_User" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor57"></a>User Profile Authorization Levels – SYSDBA, Manager and User</h3>
            <h4><a name="SYSDBA_Profile" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor58"></a>SYSDBA Profile</h4>
            <p>The Trams Back Office program comes with one Administrator Profile built with an Authorization level of SYSDBA. By default, this User Profile's Login Code is SYSDBA and uses the password which came in the welcome e-mail to the agency. For security purposes, the SYSDBA default password should be changed during the installation process.</p>
            <p>The SYSDBA profile is used to create, modify or delete other User Profiles. It can access the Help menu, access the File menu, reset its own password, and create users with Manager Authorization under Utilities | Setup | User Logins. In order to perform other managerial functions, your agency will need to create a user profile with the Authorization level of Manager.</p>
            <p>Only one User Profile can be established with an authorization level of SYSDBA. Why? Trams Back Office assumes the System Database Administrator is the only one that needs to know the passwords for all users, any sensitive payroll information, etc. The SYSDBA sets permission levels for all users, preventing all or selected users access to any sensitive agency information. Set all other User Profiles to User authorization. An unlimited number of User Profiles can be set up and each can be tailored to authorize access to specific areas in Trams Back Office.</p>
            <p>The SYSDBA login name cannot be changed. Agency staff members requiring access to Trams Back Office should each be assigned a unique profile and password.</p>
            <p>If a new password is not assigned to the SYSDBA Profile and no additional User Profiles are created, anyone entering the Trams Back Office system is, by default, signed in as a Manager with full access to every area of the program. Passwords provide security.</p>
            <p>When creating new User Logins, be sure to review the Menu Items and Permissions tab options and adjust them according to the tasks the User will be performing. If the User will be downloading and processing interface records, they will need both the “View Full Credit Card Numbers” and “Run Reports/Export with full Credit Card Numbers and view REC LOC content” permissions enabled.</p>
            <p>User Logins created in ClientBase Windows are marked as disabled in Trams Back Office and have no Trams Back Office permissions by default</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>

            <p>To change the SYSDBA password in TBO, go to Utilities|Setup|User Profiles. Highlight the User Name, SYSDBA, enter the new password and click Update. Warning: Take care when entering the password, as there is not a prompt to repeat the password. Make sure to write the password down for reference.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that if your agency is on InterBase XE or earlier, you are limited to 8 characters in a password. (Longer passwords are saved, but all characters after the eighth are ignored.) We recommend that you upgrade to a current version of InterBase.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h4><a name="Manager_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Manager Profiles</h4>
            <p>Except for Database Backup, which requires SYSDBA, a Manager log-in can do all the things that SYSDBA could do previously. Some functions, for example, creating or modifying user logins, will prompt the Manager to enter the SYSDBA password before allowing them to proceed. However, they are still logged in under their own user login.</p>
            <p>If you have scheduled tasks that use the SYSDBA login, you will need to update them to use the Manager's username and password.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <h4><a name="User_Profiles_..158" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>User Profiles</h4>
            <p>An unlimited number of User Profiles can be set up and each can be tailored to authorize access to specific areas in Trams Back Office.  While an unlimited number of profiles can be created, the number of profiles concurrently signed into Trams Back Office will be determined by the number of user licenses in the agency’s contract.  If you require additional user licenses, please contact your account manager.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="p_2">To EUA enable the database a special command line prompt: cbplusup.exe –eua must be used when running the CBPlusUP. When the command line prompt is used, if the above requirements are not met the user is prompted,</p>
            <p class="p_21">The following requirements must be met to EUA enable the database:</p>
            <p class="p_22">- Database Server version must be upgraded to version “10” or greater. The current version is “X”.</p>
            <p class="p_22">- Database File version must be upgraded to version “15” or greater. The current version is “X”</p>
            <p class="p_22">- Database Client version must be upgraded to version “10” or greater. The current version is “X”</p>
            <p class="p_21">Please verify these requirements are met and try EUA enabling again.</p>
            <p class="p_2">If the requirements for EUA enabling the database are met the user is prompted, <span class="span_1">You have the option of using Embedded User Authentication. Your user logins and passwords will now be directly tied to your database file. Enable EUA? </span></p>
            <p class="p_23">- <span>Help|About</span> includes a new entry: <span class="span_1">EUA Enabled Yes|No</span></p>
            <p class="p_2">Upon EUA enabling a database all User Login passwords are converted and stored within the database, rather than within InterBase. The SYSDBA password remains unchanged. Upon logging into <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Back Office as SYSDBA after EUA enabling the database, continue using the original SYSDBA password. If that password was never changed from the generic "xxxxxxxxx" password, a prompt launches upon first login to change the password.</p>
            <p class="p_2">All other User Logins have their current password converted to their login name (which is always Upper Case). As each user first logs into <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Back Office (or ClientBase) they will need to use their newly converted password based on their login name. For example, if the User Login name is MARY, upon first logging into <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Back Office the user should enter MARY into the Login Name <span>AND</span> enter MARY into the password. Upon successfully entering the User Login and Password the user is then prompted to enter a new password, to ensure security going forward. This new password is then used each time the user logs into <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Back Office. Because the database is EUA enabled, all users can now update their own User Login passwords by going to <span>Utilities|Setup|User Profile</span> and entering a new password.</p>
            <p class="p_2">A new setting was added to the Utilities menu called User Login Password Settings. When "Enable Password Expiration" is checked, you can set up how often (number of days) a password should expire. If a User Login password expires as a result of this setting, upon login the user will be prompted to enter the current login and password and then enter (and re-enter) a new password. This setting must be turned on by a user with manager authorization.</p>
            <p class="p_15">PASSWORD EXPIRATION</p>
            <p class="p_2">Enter the number of days until password is expired (Example: 30, 60, 90, etc.). If you are also a CBO user, the maximum time allowed for a password to be used before resetting is 90 days. Once password expires, when user tries to login user is directed to a new page and asked to enter the old password and a new password.</p>
            <p><span class="span_3">PASSWORD STRENG</span><span class="span_3">T</span><span class="span_3">H</span>
            </p>
            <p class="p_2">A setting was also added to assign password strength when creating a new password. If a chosen password does not meet the rules, user must change password before allowed to continue. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Options are low, medium or high and are described as follows:</p>
            <p class="p_23"><span>Low Strength</span> - Passwords must contain:</p>

            <p class="p_2">For security purposes certain passwords are no longer allowed to be used in the database. The default that came with the program is no longer allowed for use as a password for SYSDBA. After EUA enabling the database, if the SYSDBA password is the default, or if at any point you are changing the SYSDBA password and you try to use the default, you are prompted to select a different password.</p>
            <p class="p_2">For user logins, the user login name and the user password can no longer be the same. After EUA enabling the database, if you try to create a password that matches the user login name, you are prompted to select a different password. </p>
            <p class="p_15">IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT SYSDBA PASSWORD</p>
            <p class="p_24">It is extremely important that you archive the SYSDBA password to a removable storage drive as a source of password recovery. If the SYSDBA password is forgotten and was not archived, the password cannot be recovered. </p>
            <p class="p_2">To archive, when changing the SYSDBA password enter the new password and check the box <span class="span_1">Archive Password</span>. Click <span class="span_1">OK </span>to save and a popup screen is displayed to create a password recovery disk. </p>
            <p class="p_2">The prompt appears, <span class="span_1">Please insert your password recovery drive/disk and select the appropriate drive letter to archive the password. To refresh the drive list, click the drop down arrow. Then press OK to continue or Cancel to stop the process.</span> Click the arrow and select the drive to save the password to and click <span class="span_1">OK</span>. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Once the password is on the drive the prompt, <span class="span_1">Password successfully archived</span> is displayed. Should the need arise to recover the password from the removable device, in the login screen, click the <span class="span_1">Forgot Password</span> link (which is only visible with the SYSDBA Login), then insert the removable device and navigate the removable device drive. Once logged in, the SYSDBA password should be changed and re-archived.</p>

Multiple Balance Sheets are available, but are generally only needed if there is a need to print full financials - Balance Sheet and Income Statement - per branch or entity for tax reporting. This is usually only needed if there are branches in separate states, or if for some other reason, separate balance sheets are needed.</p>

They will assist with the following steps:</p>
            <p class="p_2">1. Turn all unapplied balances on both Client and Vendor Balances reports into vouchers.</p>
            <p class="p_2">2. Select <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults</span> and remove the check marks from Allow Client Unapplieds and Allow Vendor Unapplieds.</p>

            <p class="p_2">4. Select <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults</span> and click the Prompt tab and change Allow Branch Entries to Full Multiple Balance Sheet.</p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Note: </span>There is a prompt to enter an Access Code” before proceeding. E-mail <span>Trams.AccountingDesk@sabre.com</span> to receive this code and to be informed of the consequences of changing the system to a “Multiple Balance Sheet” setup.</p>
            <p class="p_2">5. Also under <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults</span>, enter a new 6000 series account set up under <span>G/L Accounts|Others</span> called the <span class="span_1">Inter-Branch Transfer</span> General Ledger account.

            <p><span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> supports multiple branches. The number of branches available is 1000 (used to be 250).</p>
            <p class="p_2">Enter an ARC/BSP number for each branch. (If the agency is <span>not</span> using the branch capability, enter the agency ARC/BSP information in Branch ’0’. Actually <span class="span_1">Trams</span> regards the main branch as Branch 0, and subsequent branches as Branch 1, 2, etc.) This information prints on the agency's ARC/BSP report. Fill in agency data and select <span class="span_1">Update</span>, which enters that information in the grid below. Click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save and exit the screen.</p>
            <p class="p_2">Agencies using the multiple branch version of <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> have the option of separating financial activity for each branch, or grouping them together. A branch can represent an STP location, a cost center, or a different department. <span>There can be multiple branches with the same ARC/BSP number, and/or multiple ARC/BSP numbers with the same G/L branch. Each branch uses the same chart of accounts. To make certain </span><span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span><span> is ready for multiple branches, check the setting in the Utilities|Setup|Global Default section under the </span><span class="span_1">Prompt</span><span> tab. </span></p>
            <p class="p_2">The <span class="span_1">Trams</span> license manager tracks the number of active branches. A new branch CANNOT be created if it exceeds the number of branches in the Software License Agreement. </p>

            </p>
            <p class="p_2">Access the G/L branch field in many different reports. To set up the General Ledger structure for multiple branches, go to <span>Utilities|Setup|Branches</span>, and select <span>ARC/BSP Numbers</span>. Click on the branch, bringing information to the top of the ARC/BSP screen. Type in the full ARC/BSP number, agency name, and agency address, and assign a number to each branch in the G/L Br field. Click <span class="span_1">Update</span> to save. This allows grouping of multiple branch locations to the same G/L account number for financial reporting purposes.</p>
            <p>Branches can now be added and deleted. A branch cannot be deleted if there is a profile, invoice or payment record assigned to it. Branch numbers of deleted branches can be re-used. All newly added branches are added to the end of the list of branches, even if they are reusing a number from a deleted branch that used to be higher up. </p>
            <p class="p_30">The order of branches can be changed using the up and down arrows on the right side of the screen. This sort order is shared by all Trams products. </p>
            <p class="p_30">Information from a copied Branch can be used to update an existing Branch or to create a new Branch. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Branches can only be added, deleted, or re-ordered on the Primary copy of the database.</p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Note:</span> As branches are being entered after Branch 0, change the default branch field in the <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults Prompt</span> tab for easier data entry. Also, it is possible to make a branch inactive if it is no longer in existence, has activity on it, and is not wanted to appear on the drop-downs. It does appear, however, on the invoice/payment screens since TBO needs to display inactive branches for edit purposes.</p>
            <p class="p_2">The Branch ID field is for those agencies (usually ADS or TravelBase) that currently use the first 3 digits of the Interface ID to separate their branches. If this field is used, insert the first 3 digits for branch identity, and make sure to go to <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults|Interface/Mail Merge Prompt</span>, and check the <span class="span_1">Read Branch ID from I/F ID </span>area. Every single client must have this branch ID as the first 3 digits of the Interface ID, or this will not work.</p>
            <p class="p_2">Associate branches with a specific bank account or CC Merchant bank account. Based on the <span class="span_1">Payment Method</span> and <span class="span_1">Branch </span>selected when doing payments, the correct bank account for that branch and payment type is defaulted based on entries here. <span>Note: </span>When changing the branch number on a payment, TBO defaults to the bank account lined to that branch set up in this area. The bank account should agree with the default bank account for the branch selected.</p>
            <p class="p_2">There are also fields per branch to put in the <span class="span_1">Sales Invoice No Start </span>and the <span class="span_1">Refund Invoice No Start </span>for manual entry.

            <p class="p_2">Larger Canadian agencies have branches in multiple Provinces. GST applies to most agencies with branches all in one province and the current rate is 7%.

It's an either or situation. The taxes are handled the same through the EOP. </p>
            <p class="p_2">An agency with branches with the same GST/HST rate would set this up under <span>Utilities|Setup|Global Defaults|Tax-Related Prompt, </span>and leave this area blank.

            <p class="p_2">Travel Types in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> are categories to organize bookings by the type of travel that they represent. For example, it is often useful to see a breakdown of the agency business by travel type. The travel types are initially set up as shown below. Modify any of the 50 available travel types to correspond to a needed category. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Note: </span><span class="span_1">Trams</span> still recommends that agencies not use travel types and purpose other than true types of travel. Having 50 different travel types is unnecessary and not easily managed. Errors in capturing the correct travel type are considerable amplified.</p>
            <p class="p_2">Remember that travel types correspond to certain General Ledger accounts (Sales, Cost of Sales, Commission). If any of the travel types are changed, be sure to change the corresponding G/L accounts (see below). </p>
            <p class="p_2">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 1 welcome/chapter 3 utilities_9.jpg" style="height: 298px;width: 548px;" alt="http://static.trams.com/tbo36/images/TFW%20Utilities.03.1.17.jpg" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p class="p_2">Rearrange the Travel Types order on drop-down menus by using the <span class="span_1">Move Up and Move Down </span>buttons - the number assigned to travel types does not change therefore, *TT descriptor code entries will not be affected in either manual entries or scripted entries. However, if the agency plans to interface, we recommend NOT changing or renaming DomAir, Hotel, Car, Rail, Int'l. In general, we recommend <span class="span_1">leaving the first ten Travel Types alone</span>, as changing them would affect interface, although the order in which they appear on drop-downs in TBO can be customized, travel types do not save unless there is a travel type by the name of <span class="span_1">Intl Air</span>.</p>
            <p class="p_2">Travel types can be edited by going to <span>Utilities|Setup|Travel Types</span>. This screen has 5 columns. The first column contains the travel type number. The second column contains the travel types to use in the invoice booking screen. The third column contains pre-defined categories used to group travel types. Click on the travel type. These categories are viewed by clicking on the arrow, then click on any type, make any changes, and click <span class="span_1">Update</span> to save those changes. Travel Categories are used to facilitate the Interface from the GDS with uniform travel types. During the Interface, <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> searches this Travel Category column for a similar match. When it finds a match in the Category column, this record is interfaced to the proper Travel Type. </p>
            <p class="p_2">The fourth and fifth columns contains default Inside and Outside Agent rates or amounts for each travel type. Set up any or all of the Travel Types with a Rate/Amount for Inside Agents, Outside Agents or both. If there is both a Rate and Amount entered for a Travel Type under Utilities, or in the Agent Profile, the Rate takes precedence and both a Rate and an Amount WILL NOT be captured for that Travel Type.</p>

            <p class="p_2">1. If an Agent Rate is specified at the booking level of the PNR, then that rate is entered into the Agent Tab of the Booking Screen during the processing of the interface records. </p>
            <p class="p_2">2. If NO rate was specified in the PNR, then any rate by Travel Type specified on the Default Rate Tab of the Agents Profile is used. </p>
            <p class="p_2">3. If NO rate is specified in the Default Rate Tab of the Agents Profile, then the rate specified globally under <span>Utilities/Setup/Travel Types</span> is used. </p>
            <p class="p_2">4. If there are no rates specified in the Default Rate Tab of the Agent Profile or in Utilities Travel Types, then the Inside or Outside Rate specified on the General Tab of the Agent Profile is used. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Note</span>: These default tables, both in Utilities and in the Agent Profile, are only used during Interface Processing. The amount is added for the agent for each booking with that travel type in it. If both a Supplier and Comm Track booking for cruise/tour credit card transactions are being created, both bookings show the same amount. When manually entering bookings in TBO, the system works if Inside and/or Outside Rates are entered on the <span class="span_1">General Tab</span> of the Agent Profile, then those rates are used for whatever booking is manually being created. To assign a different rate based on Travel Type, change the rate on the Agent Tab of the booking screen. </p>

            </p>
            <p>To accommodate the new banking check requirements that went into effect in Canada on 31 Dec, 2006. There are three merge fields:</p>
            <p>Date Year (YYYY) </p>
            <p>Date Month (MM)</p>
            <p>Date Day (DD)</p>
            <p>To add the Canadian required YYYY, MM, or DD under the appropriate component of the date fields, add a text box with the appropriate identifier under each date field.</p>
            <p>4. Any field to print on the check more than once, requires more than one setting. For example, if this is a a two-voucher check and the date is required to print on the check and the two vouchers, there will be three date settings, each with a different measurement from the top. </p>
            <p><strong class="bold_arial">Example:</strong> Let’s assume this is a two-voucher check. The check information is printed on the first voucher. Since some of the same fields are to be printed on the voucher, create duplicate fields and position them on the voucher where they are to print. The confirmation number and remarks are to be printed on the second voucher. In the check set-up, select <span class="span_1">Insert Field</span>, and click <span class="span_1">Confirmation Number</span>. Measure <span class="span_1">down</span> from the top of the check where the information is to be printed. Enter that number in the <span class="span_1">Properties</span> area of the field; or simply drag and drop the field where it is to be printed. Measure from the <span class="span_1">left</span> of the check, and enter that number in the <span class="span_1">Left</span> field on the <span class="span_1">Properties</span> screen. Continue with the <span class="span_1">Width</span> and <span class="span_1">Height </span>measurements. To add remarks, click on <span class="span_1">Insert Field </span>and select <span class="span_1">Remarks.</span> (That field may have to be re-sized quite a bit to get that to print on the check.)</p>
            <p><strong class="bold_arial">Another Example:</strong> There is a three-part voucher check and all the information from Voucher 1 and Voucher 2 needs to be printed on Voucher 3 (the one to keep for office records). Create duplicate entries of each field, changing the length from the <span class="span_1">Top </span>by dragging and dropping the field or by using the <span class="span_1">Properties area. </span>The following are sample setting for a three-part voucher check.</p>

            <p>Questions to ask if there are difficulties printing checks.</p>
            <p>- Did I indicate the correct size of my checks?</p>
            <p>- Is the height set high enough to accommodate the printer font? The default is .18. If the settings all look correct but nothing is printing on the checks, try resizing this text box or setting the height of the settings at .25 in the <span class="span_1">Properties</span>.</p>
            <p>- Are the settings overlapping? </p>
            <p>- Do I have the setting printing off the check -- too far to the right or off the bottom? (i.e.: the check width is 8.0 and it is set to begin printing at 8.5). </p>
            <p>- If the last part of the entry doesn’t appear, resize the text box. It may not be set high enough to accommodate the extra lines. <span>Example:</span> Only the first two lines of the Payee Name and Address appear. </p>
            <p>- A payroll JE requires several lines. If the settings appear correct but the JE is not printing, check the height of the setting. It may not be set high enough to accommodate the multiple entries.</p>

            <p>2. Manually load conversion codes and rates under <span>Utilities|Setup|Conversion Rates</span>. Since currency rates fluctuate, the rates should be updated periodically.</p>
            <p>a. Fill in the conversion rate for each currency and click <span class="span_1">Add</span> to see it in the data entry box below. A warning message of Duplicate Currency Code is displayed when trying to add a duplicate conversion rate. </p>

            <p>If a hotel or car transaction is interfaced and no local currency equivalent has been loaded by a hotel vendor, (hence the hotel’s currency is not shipped in the interface file) during the <span>Interface/Download</span> routine, a look up on the conversion rate table will take place. If the currency code and rate are found in the conversion rate table, the foreign currency amount is converted to your agency's local currency in the booking record. The foreign currency tab in the booking displays the hotel currency code and rate used for the conversion process.</p>

            <p>Agencies today are choosing to change the way they make their bookings. Many are dropping out of ARC/BSP and booking air tickets through a Host Agency. They may also book some or all of their cruise and tour business with a Host Agency, or continue doing those bookings as they always have. These Independent Contractors (IC) agents working through a Host Agency, may still operate a store front location, or move into a home-based environment.</p>
            <p>Independent Contractors need a method to tag and transmit invoices to the Host Agency who have <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Back Office, and Host Agencies need a method to tag and transmit invoices to ICs who have TBO. Both ICs and Host Agencies need a way to receive and differentiate invoices created from various ICs/Hosts from their own. So the first step for both the ICs and the Host Agency is to setup IC/Host Codes to "turn on" the Host or IC functions in TBO and ClientBase. </p>
            <p>For complete instructions on how to do this setup, use the IC/Host functionality, as well as download an <a href="http://www.trams.com/home/products_services/products/ic_host_agency_export_utility/" class="Hyperlink">Export Utility click here.</a></p>

            <p>Automated credit card processing uses the <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> CC Merchant form of payment. This form of payment is designed to distinguish credit card payments processed by the vendor from those that are processed by the agency. When running a query for processing, only those records with CC Merchant as the form of payment appear in the query. </p>
            <p>The agency front office can enter CC Merchant payments either through ClientBase or interface them through the GDS, using the formats outlined in the <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> Interface Guide for the agency’s particular reservation system. The formats consist of one or two "accounting" lines that are entered in addition to any descriptive entries in the Passenger Name Record. The accounting entry correctly identifies (but is not limited to) the following data: <span class="span_1">Booking Amount, Commission, CC Merchant Form of Payment, Credit Card Number and Expiration Date, Vendor, </span>and <span class="span_1">Travel Type</span>. For more information, please refer to the <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Interface Guide for the GDS system.

            <p>The credit card merchant processing feature is designed to query and process CC Merchant payments and reconcile the results of processing back to the <span class="span_1">Trams</span> accounting data. Some setup is required before processing. </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1:</span> Since the agency is receiving deposits for merchant transactions, create a profile in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> for the processing company. This is done prior to setting up the CC merchant processing defaults. Select <span>Profiles|Other</span> and create the profile. </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2:</span> Some agencies have a specific bank account that is dedicated only to CC Merchant payments. If setting up a new bank account for this, add the bank account before setting up the CC Merchant processing defaults. To add a bank account, select <span>Utilities|Setup|Bank Accounts</span>. In the <span class="span_1">Description</span> field, identify the bank account as the CC Merchant account and click <span class="span_1">Add</span>. If funds from the CC Merchant processing are handled through a standard operating account, proceed to Step 3.</p>

In the <span class="span_1">Default CC Merchant Bank Acct</span> field, type in the bank account number that for the CC Merchant payments to default. If processing CC Merchant payments against multiple bank accounts, enter the account that is used most frequently. Next, in the same <span class="span_1">Prompt</span> tab, verify that the field <span class="span_1">Allow Client Unapplieds</span> is not checked.

            <p><span>CC Merchant Fees:</span> Some processing companies charge a fee for each transaction processed. If the processing company charges a fee per transaction, in the <span class="span_1">CC Merchant Fees</span> field, type in the GL account number assigned in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> for the transaction fees.

            <p><span>Use the </span><span class="span_1">Trams</span><span> Backup Utility</span>. Use the <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Backup Utility (Ibbackup.exe) to create a Trams.gbk.zip file. This file would be used to restore the database should the need arise. Backing up just the database file (.gdb or .IB) would not provide the ability to restore a database, as it is not a restorable file. Restoring a.gbk.zip backup file also re-indexes the database files.</p>
            <p><span>Backup must be done regularly</span>. Backup every day, prior to adding more data to the system,. Formatting two sets of backup media (Flash drive, i.e.), and labeling them "A" and "B" is recommended. Rotate the media, using one, then the other. Suggestion to take an extra backup once a week and take it off-site. To start the backup utility, go to <span>Start|Programs|Trams Back Office|</span><span class="span_1">Database Backup</span>. </p>

            <p><span>Database Path</span>: By default below the <span class="span_1">Database Alias</span> is the path where the data currently resides that was setup in the Alias Utility. </p>
            <p><span>Username: </span>By default the SYSDBA is the <span class="span_1">Username.</span> </p>
            <p><span>Password: </span>Enter the password for the SYSDBA. </p>
            <p><span>Server Username and Server Password:</span> Are used when backing up an EUA enabled database. For EUA databases, there's a server-wide SYSDBA user and a database SYSDBA user that are different. Both need to be specified. For non-EUA databases, just the traditional username/password needs to be specified.</p>
            <p><span>Backup Type: </span>Choose <span class="span_1">Full Backup, Full Dump, or Incremental Dump. (</span>For more details on the Full Dump and Incremental Dump options, please refer to the <span class="span_12">Disaster Recovery</span> section below.)</p>
            <p><span>Backup To: </span>Enter or search for the drive, medium, or directory to which to backup. </p>
            <p><span>Compress Backup File: </span>Place a checkmark in the <span class="span_1">Compress Backup File</span> box to compress the backup file. </p>
            <p><span>Encrypt Backup File/Password/Confirm: </span>An option to encrypt and password protect the backup file. If a password is specified during the backup and the backup is being compressed, the resulting zip file will be encrypted using AES 256 encryption. </p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>When restoring a compressed backup that is password-protected, if the user specifies an invalid password, then the restore will fail. <span class="span_1">If the encryption password is lost, there is currently no method for recovering the password and the encrypted backup cannot be restored.</span> </p>
            <p><span>Validate DB prior To Backup:</span> The validate option works with both backup and restore steps. Validating on restore is a bit slower, but it ensures that the database is valid. Validating on the backup is much slower than a normal backup and the validation does not fix issues. A database that is restored and fails validation will have the db fail flag set. Users cannot log in until the restore is complete, regardless of whether validation is done.</p>
            <p><span>Create a Shortcut: </span>Once the backup utility is set up for the first time, clicking the button creates a shortcut on the desktop that can be used every time backup is performed. All of the settings/options will be retained. </p>

            <p><span>Dump Copy:</span> Similar to a full backup, creates a new Dump file, compresses it, then stores the file in the target location. The resulting file will be larger than a normal full backup, but should get created faster.</p>
            <p><span>Dump Full:</span> Creates a new Dump file on the server, overwriting any existing dump file with the same name. The target directory must be located on the server or be on a shared folder that the server can access.</p>
            <p><span>Dump Incremental:</span> Updates an existing Dump file on the server with any changes since the last update.</p>
            <p><span>Dump Full or Dump Incremental. </span>If the file doesn't already exist, then this works like a Dump Full and a new Dump file is created. Dump Full/Incremental creates a file with the same name as the database but ending in .DMP instead of .IB.</p>

            <p>Copy the .DMP file to the directory where the database is normally located and rename to .IB. Connect to the database via IB Console and change the Read Only property under Options on the General tab of Database Properties from TRUE to FALSE.</p>

            <p>- The Dump file is an exact copy of the database, except in read-only mode. Any corruption present in the original database will carry over to the Dump copy. It is still recommended to create periodic full backups using the original method.</p>
            <p>- The Dump file should be restored to the same version of Interbase where it was created. Moving to a newer version of Interbase should be ok, but moving to an older version won't work.</p>
            <p>- The Dump file is typically maintained on the same server as the database. Recommendation is that the Dump file be stored on a separate volume on the server so that a disk failure won't affect both the database and the dump file. It's possible to store the dump file on a separate server, but it requires additional configuration.</p>
            <p>- The Online Dump process can run while users are in the system and while a Full Backup is being run.</p>

            <p>In this case it is preferable to use <span>Remote Server</span>, a <span>Server Name</span> of localhost, an appropriate <span>Network Protocol </span>(usually TCP/IP) and an <span>Alias Name</span> to identify the server in the configuration.</p>

            <p>a. First, right click in the Program/script box and select paste.</p>
            <p>b. Press the End key on your keyboard.</p>
            <p>c. Press the Backspace key to delete characters from the end of what you pasted, until you reach ibbackup.exe" and do not delete the quote mark.</p>
            <p>d. What you should have left is this (or something very similar):</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>e. Alternatively, at this step, you could have clicked Browse… and found the ibbackup.exe program under the C drive, Program Files (x86)\Trams\Common Files.</p>
            <p>8. Next, we need to get the correct portion of that command line into the "Add Arguments" box.</p>
            <p>a. Right click in the "Add Arguments" box and select paste.</p>
            <p>b. Press the Home key on your keyboard.</p>
            <p>c. Press the Delete key (not Backspace) until you reach the first dash symbol, do not delete the dash. Next to the dash should be "UserName."</p>
            <p>d. With the cursor still at the left side of the box, type "-auto" and a space. What you should see is this:</p>

            </p>
            <p>e.Click Next.</p>
            <p>9. Check the box that says "Open the Properties dialog for this task when I click Finish." Click Finish.</p>

            </p>
            <p>10. Check the box that says Run with Highest Privileges.</p>
            <p>11. Under the Security options, you can have the task run if the Windows user that created the task is logged on, but it would be more common to set it to "Run whether user is logged on or not." If you set this option, when you click on Okay, it will prompt you to enter your Windows password for this user.</p>

            <p>When backing up the TBO database, the Report Directory or the Spool Directory/s are NOT backed up. Make a separate backup for all TBO reports and the spool directory/s. The easiest way to do this is to use the following instructions:</p>
            <p>1. Select <span>Start|Programs|Accessories|System Tools|Backup</span>. </p>
            <p>2. Follow the Backup Wizard, and place a checkmark in the <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Reports folder found where the <span class="span_1">TRAMS</span> Reports where installed in the <span class="span_1">Trams </span>program group.</p>
            <p>3. Then, browse for the backup destination found on the bottom of the backup screen. (Some versions of Windows may have the backup destination on the next screen.) </p>
            <p>4. Click on <span class="span_1">Start Backup</span> to start backing up, or <span class="span_1">Schedule Jobs</span>. (If selecting <span class="span_1">Schedule Jobs</span>, backup files will be backed up as scheduled. Make sure that to backup to a CB-RW or a USB Drive, etc., and that the system time and data are correct when using this option.)</p>
            <p>5. Repeat the process for the Spool Directory/s.</p>

            <p><span>NEVER restore the Trams.ib</span> until the backup has been restored some place else by following the procedures outlined below. The agency may be instructed by our support department to do a backup and then restore the database. This could be to re-index certain database tables or to troubleshoot some other issue. In any event, following these steps will ensure the integrity of the database backup, and will alleviate the possibility of restoring over an existing database. These steps should work for any version of Interbase, <span>but not for doing an upgrade of Interbase</span>. </p>
            <p>Close out of TBO (and <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>) to restore data. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Select the <span class="span_1">Restore Tab</span>. The restore function recovers backup data saved on medium that used the <span class="span_1">Trams</span> backup function. <span class="span_1">Restore</span> replaces current data files with those on the backup medium. This restore program <span>restores both </span><span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span><span> and </span><span class="span_1">ClientBase</span><span> Data. Since the two programs share a common database, restore cannot be done on one without affecting the other. </span></p>
            <p>1) Make sure everyone is out of <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>, <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> and any other applications connecting to the database.</p>
            <p>2) If the database is a Sync database, please go to scheduled tasks in the Control Panel in Windows. If the task that controls synchronization is currently running, please wait for it to finish (refresh the screen). Once it is not running (status Ready), disable the task by double- clicking it and un-checking the box that says <span class="span_1">Enabled</span> and then clicking <span class="span_1">Apply/Okay</span>.</p>
            <p>3) Perform a backup of the database.</p>
            <p>4) Shut down the Interbase Guardian service. Go to <span>Control Panel|Administrative Tools|Services</span> and then highlighting Interbase Guardian and clicking <span class="span_1">Stop Service</span>. This will automatically stop the Interbase Server service as well.</p>
            <p>5) In Windows Explorer go where the Trams.ib is located and rename it from Trams.ib to Trams.ib.old.</p>
            <p>6) Start the Interbase Guardian Service (as before, the Interbase Server service will be updated automatically).</p>
            <p>7) Restore the backup that was done in Step 2. It <span class="span_3">should not</span> prompt that it's overwriting an existing database. Go to <span>Start|Programs|</span><span class="trams_1">Trams Back Office|Database Backup</span>. Click on the Restore tab.</p>
            <p><span>Database Alias: </span><span class="span_1">Database Alias</span> from the drop-down. This is the database which will be backed up.</p>
            <p><span>Database Path</span>: By default below the <span class="span_1">Database Alias</span> is the path where the data currently resides. This was setup in the Alias Utility. </p>
            <p><span>Username: </span>By default the SYSDBA is the <span class="span_1">Username.</span></p>
            <p><span>Password: </span>Enter the password for the SYSDBA.</p>
            <p><span>Server Username/Server Password: </span>In preparation for Password Management enhancements in <span class="span_1">ClientBase Windows</span> and <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>, there are new fields on the Backup Utility called Server Username and Server Password. These fields should be left blank when performing a backup or restore. </p>
            <p><span>Restore From: </span>Enter or search for the drive, medium, or directory to which the backup was performed and find the Trams.gbk.zip file. </p>
            <p><span>Page Size: </span>The Page Size option with choices &lt;default&gt;, 4K, 8K and 16K (for Interbase 2007 and higher) are for users who have Interbase 2007 installed. Restoring a database with a larger page size results in a performance increase in the database. Typically the time needed for the database to send data requested by the application has been decreased up to 10% (comparing 4kb to 16 kb page size). </p>
            <p><span>Encrypt Password: </span>Type the password used when backing up and encrypting the database. When restoring a compressed backup that is password-protected, if the user specifies an invalid password, then the restore will fail. <span>Note: </span>When restoring a compressed backup that is password-protected, if the user specifies an invalid password, then the restore will fail. <span class="span_1">If the encryption password is lost, there is currently no method for recovering the password and the encrypted backup cannot be restored.</span> </p>
            <p><span>Validate DB prior To Backup/Restore:</span> The validate option works with both backup and restore steps. Validating on restore is a bit slower, but it ensures that the database is valid. Validating on the backup is much slower than a normal backup and the validation does not fix issues. A database that is restored and fails validation will have the db fail flag set. Users cannot log in until the restore is complete, regardless of whether validation is done.<span>Overwrite Existing Database: </span>Check here to overwrite the existing database.</p>
            <p>8) Once verifying that the restore completed successfully, have everyone go back into TBO and/or ClientBase. (Leave the renamed database and the backup in place until everyone is satisfied that the system is working correctly).</p>
            <p>9) If the Sync scheduled task was disabled in Step 2, go back into the sync task's properties and enable it.</p>
            <p>If there are any questions about these steps or there is any difficulty in following them, don't hesitate to contact our support department.</p>

            <p>Located under <span>Utilities|Purge</span>, there is a required order that must be followed in order to ultimately purge invoices. All purge routines require a date. An attempt to purge data prior to that date will be made, there are rules where some data may not be purged, details reside each step. </p>
            <p>1. Reopen periods. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- This routine reformats the end of period and year end postings so they become like a standard journal entry in preparation for step 2.</p>
            <p>2. Purge Journal Entries.</p>
            <p class="p_13">-- This routine will purge any posted journal entries (including the end of period and year end entries created in step 1 prior to the date designated).</p>
            <p>3. Purge Payments/Payables. In order to purge a payment the following rules apply:</p>
            <p class="p_35">-- Only payables that are not linked to a journal entry and have a status of paid will be purged. </p>
            <p class="p_35">-- Payments with a blank date cleared field will not be purged.</p>
            <p class="p_35">-- Once payments are 'purged' the status changes to 'closed' and they no longer have a payment number and will be completely purged with step 4.</p>
            <p>4. Purge Invoices. In order to purge an invoice the following rules apply:</p>
            <p class="p_13">-- The Invoice Status cannot be Open.</p>
            <p class="p_13">-- The Partial Payment Amount must equal zero.</p>
            <p class="p_13">-- Invoice and bookings must not reference any payments (See step 3).</p>
            <p class="p_13">-- No bookings can have a client or vendor status of Open.</p>
            <p class="p_13">-- Bookings must not reference a Rescard Reservation.</p>
            <p class="p_13">-- Agent Bookings must not reference a payment.</p>
            <p>5. Note: Profiles are not purged</p>

            <p>* Once data has been purged, reports cannot be run in the purged period. </p>
            <p>* * The actual purging of the data may not affect the size of the backup, or the actual size of the database. </p>

            <p>1) Backup the Trams database and store this backup in for archiving purposes.</p>
            <p>2) Test the backup before starting the purge (see section, Procedure for Testing the Integrity of Daily Backup in this chapter). </p>
            <p>3) Run and print all General Ledger reports in detail before the purge. </p>
            <p>4) Determine the Purge Date. Keep at least two years of data. The date is based on the End of Period date. To purge all data prior to 01/01/2012, the Purge Date is 12/31/2011. All journal entries prior to the purge date must be posted before purging. </p>
            <p><span>Important NOTE:</span> Use the same date for the next 5 steps. </p>
            <p>5) Follow the Purging process in sequence starting with Reopen Period. The period to reopen is based on the End of Period and Year End posting dates. </p>
            <p>6) Purge the Posted Journal Entries. </p>
            <p>7) Purge the Payments/Payables. </p>
            <p>8) Purge the Invoices. </p>
            <p>9) Before doing any work in the new database, compare the agency's printed reports to the reports in the current database for accuracy. </p>
