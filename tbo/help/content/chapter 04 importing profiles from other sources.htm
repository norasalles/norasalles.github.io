            <p class="p_36">This section details the importing of Client, Vendor, Agent and Other profiles from other software programs using ASCII (.txt) files. The routine of importing either appends one database of profile information to an existing database (or an empty one) without checking for duplicates, or updates existing profiles if certain parameters are setup.</p>
            <h2><a name="Importing_Customer_Profiles_via_ASCII_(.txt)_Files" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Importing_Customer_Profiles_via_ASCII_(.txt)_Files" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Importing Customer Profiles via ASCII (.txt) Files</h2>
            <p class="p_2">Agencies may use many different software programs to maintain customer data such as names, addresses, phone numbers and marketing information. Ideally, most agencies implementing <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>build their database using the interface process, but they may prefer to electronically "import" customer information to the <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>/<span class="span_1">ClientBase </span>profiles rather than manually entering it. Later, when the <span class="span_1">Trams </span>database is up and running, agencies may want to import other miscellaneous electronic files as well, such as a purchased mailing list. Although <span class="span_1">Trams </span>can’t anticipate every possible program used, if your agency has a database of customer information in a program that can put that information into an ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) file (.txt), chances are an electronic “import” is possible…and easy!</p>
            <h3><a name="ASCII_Delimited_Text_Files" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="ASCII_Delimited_Text_Files" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="ASCII_Delimited_Text_Files"></a>ASCII Delimited Text Files</h3>
            <p>Regardless of the specific program used to maintain your database, if the program can create an ASCII-comma or tab delimited file (and most programs currently can using <span>File|Save As</span> or <span>File|Export</span>), that file can be imported using the <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Import/Update Utility. An ASCII format uses a standardized coding scheme enabling different computer programs to exchange information. </p>
            <p>Each record in the file includes information such as Name, Address 1, Address 2, City, etc. To recognize when one field ends and another field begins, a <span class="span_1">delimiter</span> is used, separating each field. This delimiter is a character and the most commonly used are a <span>tab</span> or a <span>comma</span>.</p>
            <p>If your existing database program can create an ASCII file, create your file and save it to a floppy disk or to a drive accessible to a workstation that can run <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office/ClientBase</span>. (The file must be created <span>prior</span> to running the Trams Import program.) Find instructions on creating the file from the vendor supporting that software program.</p>
            <h3><a name="Using_the_Trams_Import_Update_Utility" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="UsingImportUpdUtil"></a>Using the Trams Import/Update Utility</h3>
            <p>The Trams Import/Update Utility is a separate program that is run from outside of <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> or <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span>. To access this utility, go to <span>Start|Programs|</span><span class="span_1">Trams Back Office (or Trams)</span><span>|</span><span class="span_1">Trams</span><span> Profile Import</span> and make sure you have a current backup of the database before starting the import. Access the program from your <span class="span_1">Trams</span> program group or by going to <span>Start|Run</span> and browsing \<span class="span_1">Trams</span>\common files\profimp.exe file. Upon running, an import wizard appears. </p>
            <p>The wizard guides you though importing different classifications of profile data: address, communication, marketing and traveler. The basic steps to running the import are:</p>
            <p class="p_17">Step 1: Preparing your Database</p>
            <p class="p_17">Step 2: Connect to your Database</p>

            <p class="p_17">Step 12: View Profile Import/Update Summary Screen</p>
            <p>Before giving details on each step, let’s review some basic concepts used through the Import Utility screens.</p>
            <h3><a name="Updating_Existing_Profiles_vs._Appending_to_Database" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Updating_Existing_Profiles_vs._Appending_to_Database" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Updating Existing Profiles vs. Appending to Database</h3>
            <p>There are two methods of importing data - update or append. Update means you want to replace data that is currently in your database with new data. An example is John Jones is currently in the <span class="span_1">Trams </span>database. He visits your website and updates his address, letting you know he moved. You import profiles from your website every week into <span class="span_1">Trams</span>. Since the profile already exists in the<span class="span_1"> Trams </span>database, you want the import routine to find this profile and change the address instead of creating a new profile which would be a duplicate. If the entire import was updates, then the number of profiles would not increase.</p>
            <p><span>Important Note: </span><span class="span_1">As you map the fields from the import file to the fields in Trams Back Office/ClientBase, it is important to remember that any fields that are being mapped to in the database will be replaced by the value of the field in the import file, even if it is empty.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Using the append method means you are adding profiles to the database and the number of profiles in the system increase after the import is complete. An example of this is if you purchase a mailing list and want to load all the profiles into <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> so you can monitor responses and follow up on these profiles.</p>

            <p>Notice three buttons listed on many of the screens in the Import Utility that are used to describe how that data should be imported.</p>

                        <p class="p_5">Mapping is used when a data field exists and is populated in the file while importing. You want to bring the data in “as is” to a field in the database.

                        <p class="p_5">Creating a rule to import fields allows you to apply some logic to the field being imported. Create rules that if the data meets certain criteria, then map to a certain field in the database, or set a constant for the field. Let’s say the mail list you have purchased has a field name type and the value in the data source is either Home or Business. You want to make the profiles that are marked "business" as <span class="span_1">Corporate</span> profiles in your database. You create a rule that says if type is equal to “business” then set the Profile type field to <span class="span_1">Corporate</span> when importing the profile into the database. Another rule would be set where if the type is equal to “home” then the set the profile type to Leisure when importing.</p>

            <p>If you plan to import profiles on a continual basis using a consistent source file structure, map settings at the end of the import wizard. Also, if you start the mappings, but don’t have time to finish, use <span class="span_1">Save Mappings</span> to save what you’ve done so far. The next time you import a file, load the map which uses the same settings from the saved import. Now you do not have to go through the wizard field by field.

            <h3><a name="Step_1__Preparing_Your_Database" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Step1"></a>Step 1: Preparing Your Database </h3>
            <p>When you use the import utility, you make permanent and automatic changes and therefore, we suggest you make a good backup of the database before using this feature. In doing so, you are covered in case something is changed unintentionally. By backing up, you have the option to restore back your original database. </p>
            <p>Or, you may decide to setup a "test" Alias to test the import on a copy of your database before you import it live. (This procedure serves another purpose as well as it checks the integrity of the latest backup.) Here are steps to accomplish this:</p>
            <p>1. Go to <span>Start|Programs|</span><span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span><span>|Alias Utility</span>.</p>
            <p>2 Create an alias named <span class="span_1">Test</span> and type: C:\Program Files\<span class="span_1">Trams</span>\Database\test.ib (or use the same path as your current <span class="span_1">Trams</span> database). Do not click <span class="span_1">Test</span> as this database does not exist until you restore your backup to it.</p>
            <p>3. Restore the last backup to the <span class="span_1">Test</span> Alias (it creates the new test.ib when it does this). <span>IMPORTANT:</span> If you get any error message and cannot complete restore, call or e-mail support for help.</p>
            <p>4. Log into <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Back Office or <span class="span_1">ClientBase</span> as this Alias, <span class="span_1">Test</span>, and make sure all was restored correctly.</p>
            <p>5. If you can look at the details of one profile, the copy of your database is viable and you are ready to do a test import into this database copy.</p>

            <p><span class="span_1">One File for All Tables</span><span>:</span> If this box is checked, all of the data you are importing is in one file. The file updates not only the profile table, but also the communication, address, marketing and traveler tables as well. If this box is not checked, it opens up the ability to import multiple files, each a unique .txt file for each table - profile, communication, address, marketing, and traveler. This setup would be used when the source files are generated from a relational database which has separate tables in a program such as <span class="span_1">Access, dBase, or Paradox.</span> Notice that as the checkmark is removed, the communication, address, marketing and traveler areas become active. For each selected .txt file for any table, specify a <span class="span_1">Delimiter</span> from the drop-down menu (either tab or comma); check the box <span class="span_1">First Line is Header</span> to create a header for the file; and select a File Structure.</p>
