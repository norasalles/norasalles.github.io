            <p class="p_2">Two things to consider before setting up <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>:</p>
            <p class="p_2">1) Most users have a single Balance Sheet and choose to have a single Income Statement or an Income Statement per branch. Multiple Balance Sheets are available, but are generally only needed if there is a need to print full financials (Balance Sheet and Income Statement) per branch or entity for tax reporting. This is usually only needed if branches are in separate states, or if for some other reason, separate balance sheets for tax purposes are needed.</p>
            <p class="p_2">2) <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> has the ability to account for invoices as Sales/Costs of Sales or Commission Income. Some agencies have used Commission Income accounting with previous back office systems and may want to consider converting to Sales/Cost of Sales when converting to<span class="span_1"> Trams Back Office</span> as nothing is lost, but much can be gained. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Using Sales/Cost of Sales does allow for more flexibility especially with regards to yield management information, because we can track the sales/cost of sales for Commtrack invoices, based on the actual commission received. The cost of sales is determined by the difference between the total fare and the commission of the invoices that have a vendor payment. Converting from Commission Income to Sales/Cost of Sales accounting takes place at the time of loading beginning balances into <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>. When using Commission Income method accounts are "rolled up" into a Commission Income account based on the actual commission received and the sales amount is not tracked.</p>

            <h3><a name="Set_Up_Travel_Types" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Travel"></a><a name="kanchor27"></a>Set Up Travel Types</h3>
            <p class="p_2">Travel Types in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> are categories to organize bookings by the type of travel that they represent. For example, it is often useful to see a breakdown of the business by travel type. The travel types are initially set up as shown below. Modify any of the 50 available travel types to correspond to a category that are needed. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Remember that travel types define what Sales/Cost of Sales that will be updated during an EOP journal entry. If adding a travel type, be sure to create a GL account for the Sales/Cost of Sales accounts under <span>General Ledger|Accounts</span> and update the table under <span>Utilities|GL Accts</span><span class="span_1">.</span></p>
            <p class="p_20">Selecting Travel Categories</p>
            <p class="p_20">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 1 welcome/set up trams back office.jpg" style="height: 312px;width: 450px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p class="p_2">To setup Travel Types go to <span>Utilities|Setup|Travel Types</span></p>
            <p class="p_2">Rearrange the Travel Types by using the <span class="span_1">Move Up </span>and <span class="span_1">Move Down</span> buttons. However, if the agency plans to interface, we recommend NOT changing, moving or renaming DomAir, Hotel, Car, Rail, Int'l. In general, we recommend <span class="span_1">leaving the first eight Travel Types alone</span>. The first column contains the travel types used in the invoice booking screen. The second column contains pre-defined categories used to group travel types. These categories are edited by clicking on the travel type, making the changes at the top of the data entry screen and then clicking on <span class="span_1">Update</span> to save those changes. (If adding a new travel type, be sure to choose the correct Travel Category from the drop-down menu.)</p>
            <p class="p_2">Travel Categories are used to facilitate the Interface from the GDS with uniform travel types. During the Interface, <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> searches the Travel Category column for a similar match. When it finds a match in the Category column, this record is interfaced to the proper Travel Type. </p>

            <p class="p_2">We recommend that Core Reports be set up in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>prior to entering General Ledger opening balances. Opening Balances reflect the current state of the agency’s financial position the day <span class="span_3">prior</span> to the General Ledger start date in <span class="span_1">Trams. </span>Obtain opening balances from the agency’s accountant, or from the Trial Balances from the prior bookkeeping system. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span class="span_13">IMPORTANT</span>! Opening Balances don’t have to be entered in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>to use the General Ledger. However, an end a period in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office CANNOT BE CLOSED </span>without the opening balances.</p>

            <h3><a name="Set_Up_General_Ledger" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Setup"></a><a name="kanchor48"></a>Set Up General Ledger</h3>
            <p class="p_2">The General Ledger does not need to be “turned on” because it is always active. Print monthly financial reports at any time without putting in the beginning balances. However, if accurate financial reports are wanted year-to-date, it is <span class="span_1">required</span> that the General Ledger be set up with accurate beginning balances and then balance the General Ledger on a monthly basis.</p>
            <p class="p_2">1. Before beginning, establish the Four Core reports as described in previous section. After establishing the Core Reports, there is a solid foundation on which to build the General Ledger.</p>
            <p class="p_2">2. Determine the General Ledger implementation date, <span class="span_1">e.g.0</span>1/01/xx.</p>
            <p class="p_2">3. Get the General Ledger ending balances from the previous accounting program, manual bookkeeping records, or the agency accountant. The balances need to be from the day <span class="span_12">prior</span> to the implementation date. (<span class="span_1">e.g.</span> if the implementation date is 01/01/12, balances are from 12/31/11.) </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span class="span_20">Note: </span>It is not necessary to have the General Ledger ending balances to implement the General Ledger as long as the Four Core reports are accurate.</p>
            <p class="p_2">4. The <span class="span_1">Travel Types</span> table, <span class="span_1">General Ledger Accounts</span> table, and the <span class="span_1">Chart of Accounts</span> should all correspond. The Chart of Accounts should have a <span class="span_1">Sales</span> and <span class="span_1">Cost of Sales</span> account for each travel type listed in the Travel Type table. The General Ledger Accounts table should coincide with both the Chart of Accounts and Travel Type table. (For additional information on setup procedures for these tables, see General Ledger Accounts Setup below.)</p>
            <p class="p_2">5. Click <span>Reports|General Ledger|Trial Balance</span> and print the <span class="span_1">Trial Balance</span> report. Enter the <span class="span_1">As Of</span> date as one day <span class="span_3">prior</span> to the General Ledger start date, <span class="span_1">e.g.</span> 12/31/xx. Verify that the Pseudo Post box is selected. Click <span class="span_1">Preview</span> to view to the screen (or click <span class="span_1">Print</span> to send directly to the printer without viewing first). Once the report is displayed on the screen, click the Printer icon to print. Check the report for any accounts with balances. If there are accounts with balances, proceed to step 6 to <span class="span_1">zero out</span> balances, in order to start with a clean General Ledger. If the account balances on the Trial Balance are zero, skip to step 7.</p>
            <p class="p_2">6. To <span class="span_1">zero out</span> account balances on the Trial Balance report, click <span>General Ledger|Journal Entry</span> and create a <span class="span_1">journal entry</span> to reverse them. Enter the <span class="span_1">Activity Date</span> as the day <span class="span_3">prior</span> to the implementation date. In <span class="span_1">Remarks</span> field<span>,</span> type in “<span class="span_1">To Zero Out General Ledger</span>.” In the <span class="span_1">Account Name &amp; Number</span> field, enter the <span class="span_1">Account Name</span> or <span class="span_1">Number</span> or click the arrow to choose from the list. Enter the <span class="span_1">amount </span>as the opposite of how it appears on the Trial Balance report. (<span class="span_1">e.g. A</span>ccount 2000 shows a <span class="span_1">credit </span>of $400.00 on the Trial Balance. The journal entry will be a <span class="span_1">debit </span>of $400.00 to account 2000.) Once all accounts are entered and debits and credit equal, click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save. After reversing all balances, print a new Trial Balance, with Pseudo Post selected. The report should now be <span class="span_12">zero</span>. If it is not, repeat steps 4 and 5.</p>
            <p class="p_2">7. Print the Four Core Reports as of the day <span class="span_3">prior</span> to the implementation date. Verify that the Core report balances match the ending balances from the accountant or prior bookkeeping system.</p>
            <p class="p_2">8. Enter new beginning balances in the General Ledger by clicking <span>General Ledger|Journal Entry</span>. Enter the <span class="span_1">Activity Date</span> as the day <span class="span_3">prior</span> to the implementation date. In the <span class="span_1">Remarks</span> field<span>, </span>type in <span class="span_1">“Beginning Balances.”</span> In the <span class="span_1">Account Name </span><span class="span_1">&amp; Number</span> field, enter the Account Name or Number, or click the arrow to select from the list. Enter the <span class="span_1">Amount</span> in the <span class="span_1">Debit</span> or <span class="span_1">Credit</span> column. If entering balances from a previous accounting system or from the accountant, copy the information line by line. If entering <span class="span_1">Core Report balances only</span>, see below. </p>
            <p class="p_2">9. From the Check Register report, enter the <span class="span_1">Ending Balance</span> into the <span class="span_1">Cash in Bank</span> account. (1000 series number) If the ending balance on the Check Register report is positive, enter the amount in the debit column. If the ending balance is negative, enter the amount in the credit column. </p>
            <p class="p_2">10. From the Client Balances report, enter the <span class="span_1">Balance Due</span> total into the <span class="span_1">Client Balances</span> account. (1000 series number) If the report total is a positive amount, enter in the amount in the debit column. If the report total is negative, enter in the credit column. </p>
            <p class="p_2">11. From the Vendor Balances report, enter the <span class="span_1">Balance Due </span>total into the <span class="span_1">Vendor Balances</span> account. (2000 series number) If the total is a positive amount, enter in the amount in the debit column. If the total is negative, enter in the amount in the credit column. </p>
            <p class="p_2">12. For the ARC/BSP Balances, enter the <span class="span_1">Net Remit</span> balance into the <span class="span_1">ARC/BSP Balances</span> account. (2000 series number) If the ARC/BSP Balance is positive, (ARC/BSP owes the agency) enter in the debit column. If the ARC/BSP Balance is negative, (ARC/BSP is owed) enter in the credit column.</p>
            <p class="p_2">13. To balance the journal entry, put the difference between the debits and credits in the <span class="span_1">3999 - Suspense Account.</span> Set this account up if it does not already exist. (See Add To the General Ledger Chart Of Accounts in this chapter.) </p>
            <p class="p_2">14. Once all accounts are entered and debits and credits equal, click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save. If debits and credits do not balance, go back and check all the amounts in the journal entry against all the amounts from the previous Balance sheet. </p>
            <p class="p_2">15. Now print the Trial Balance Report and compare against the Four Core reports and verify that they are all in balance.</p>
            <p class="p_2">16. Finally, once having verified the General Ledger amounts are in balance, <span class="span_1">Post</span> the journal entry to the General Ledger. <span>This makes it permanent</span>. To post, click <span>General Ledger|Posting</span>. In the <span class="span_1">Latest Posting Date</span> field, enter date as the day <span class="span_3">prior</span> to the implementation date. (<span class="span_1">i.e.</span>12/31/04)</p>
            <p class="p_2"><span class="span_20">NOTE:</span> Once the journal entry has been posted, print a final copy of the Four Core Reports and the Trial Balance report to keep in the agency files.</p>
            <p class="p_2">From this point forward maintain the General Ledger on a monthly basis by balancing the General Ledger to the Four Core reports. (See <span class="span_1">Maintaining the General Ledger</span> below.)</p>

            <p class="p_2"><span>Step 1.</span> Check that the data in the IAR Sales Report matches data in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> by one of three methods: </p>
            <p class="p_23"><span>a) Method One:</span> Run a list of all invoices captured in <span class="span_1">Trams</span> by going into <span>Reports|Invoice|Analysis</span> and verifying that all invoices for the week are accounted for in <span class="span_1">Trams</span>. Then, run a list of all tickets captured in <span class="span_1">Trams</span> by going into <span>Reports|Invoice|ARC/BSP Reconciliation</span> and verifying that all tickets issued for the week are accounted for in <span class="span_1">Trams</span>, and be sure to set ticket status to <span>ALL</span>. </p>
            <p class="p_23"><span>b) Method Two:</span> Download the IAR file from the IAR website. Go to <span>Reports|Invoice|IAR Reconciliation</span> and click the IAR File button to point to the path of the downloaded .txt file obtained from the IAR website. Print out an Exception Report which points out differences between what was submitted to IAR and <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Back Office. </p>
            <p class="p_23"><span>c) Method Three:</span> Download the IAR file from the IAR website. </p>
            <p class="p_47">-- Go to <span>Payments|ARC Settlement</span>. </p>
            <p class="p_47">-- Query for the week’s ARC tickets so they are displayed on the settlement screen. </p>
            <p class="p_47">-- Click IAR Reconciliation on the ARC Settlement screen. </p>
            <p class="p_47">-- Click IAR Filename and map to the weekly IAR file. </p>
            <p class="p_47">-- Click Query to see the standard IAR Reconciliation Report. </p>
            <p class="p_47">-- For tickets where <span class="span_1">Net Remit Do Not Match</span>, <span class="span_1">Ticket Is Voided in IAR but Not in Trams</span>, or <span class="span_1">Missing IAR Ticket</span>, click <span class="span_1">Find Ticket</span> and the cursor lands on the appropriate ticket on the ARC Settlement screen so <span class="span_1">Edit Invoice</span> appears as normal. </p>
            <p class="p_47">-- For tickets that are <span class="span_1">Voided In Trams but Not In IAR</span>, click <span class="span_1">Find Ticket</span> to go to the booking containing that voided ticket in TBO, so it can be unvoided, allowing the ticket to now show correctly on the ARC Settlement Screen. </p>
            <p class="p_47">-- For any exceptions that are <span class="span_1">Missing Trams Ticket</span>, click off the IAR Reconciliation screen, and manually add the missing tickets. If doing this method, no need to do Steps 2 and 4 below. </p>
            <p class="p_47"><span>Note:</span> This is the same IAR Reconciliation exception report that was only available before under <span>Reports|Invoice|IAR Reconciliation</span>. The IAR Reconciliation from the ARC Settlement screen works the same way and provides that same exception report, but now has linking ability to the tickets displayed on the ARC Settlement Screen. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Step 2.</span> Enter any missing Refunds, Debit Memos, Voids, etc. so <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> agrees with IAR Sales Report. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Step 3.</span> Enter and balance the ARC/BSP Settlement for the week under <span>Payments|ARC Settlement</span>. Do this by comparing the amount withdrawn to the amount <span class="span_1">Trams</span> calculated as the Net Remittance amount for that ARC/BSP week. If the two numbers do not balance exactly, review the ARC/BSP Settlement section of this manual. </p>
            <p><span>Step 4.</span> Submit the IAR Sales Report. </p>
            <p>If processing through ARC/IAR, complete the ARC Settlement right after submitting the IAR Sales Report. </p>

            <p class="p_2">2. Create an End of Period journal entry (<span>General Ledger|End of Period</span>) for the month.</p>
            <p class="p_2">3. Print a trial balance. Compare the Management Summary Report balances to their corresponding General Ledger accounts and make sure they are the same. If not, print a GL Reconciliation (<span>Reports|General Ledger|GL Reconciliation</span>) to locate any possible errors. <span>Note: </span>There is a <span class="span_1">Total Base </span>column on this report, The yield percentage is the commission divided by total base.</p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Optional:</span> Run a Journal Entry Query with the <span class="span_1">Status</span> set as <span class="span_1">Unposted</span>. Run for an appropriate posted period, year-to-date of last posted period, last-year-to date of last posted period, etc., to view any unposted items that someone might have added or changed in a posted period. Verify or delete those items, post them, and run new monthly financials to reflect the changes made.</p>
            <p class="p_2">4. When (and only when) everything is in balance, post the journal entries made and print Financial Statements. Audit Trail reports could include Trial Balance, Income Statement, Balance Sheet, End of Period Reports, Account History, or Journal Entry Analysis. </p>

            <p class="p_2">A hard coded table of Provinces and their applicable GST/HST rates has been added that will be referenced during interface processing based on the rules of supply enhancement. </p>

            <p>During interface processing, before calculating QST on commission, a look up on the Vendor profile is done to determine the Vendor’s Province to apply the rules below:</p>
            <p><span class="span_24">·</span><span class="span_25">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span>If the vendor address province is outside of Canada (Province ≠ AB, BC, MB, NB, NL, NS, NT, NU, ON, PE, QC, SK, or YT), the vendor will not pay Commission QST.</p>

Commission QST is calculated using the QST rate indicated in the Utilities/Setup/Global Defaults/Tax Related tab or Utilites/Setup/Branches Record (used if QST only applies to some branches but all).&#160; In addition, if the vendor address province is Quebec (Province = QC), the Vendor will pay commission QST.</p>

            <p class="p_2">Since a large portion of the Commission GST/HST calculations will be based on the profile Province where the client and vendor resides, it is <span class="span_3">ESSENTIAL</span> to ensure the TBO client and vendor profiles contain a Province and non-Canadian Vendor profiles contain a Country code. The province should use 2 letter codes as follows: BC, AB, etc. (Please use drop-down menu to select province code.)</p>
            <p class="p_2">The lookup logic on the profile will first look for Canadian profiles by checking the country field. If the country field contains CANADA or is blank, it will look in the Province field to determine if there's a match to one of the Provinces in the rate table and if so, use the applicable rate to calculate the Commission GST/HST for the booking.</p>
            <p class="p_2">For cars, we will look for the pickup city in the itinerary field of the TBO booking, and then use the city code table to locate the province and lookup the province rate. Therefore, it is also important that the city code table (<span>Utilities|Setup|City Codes</span>) has province codes for each applicable city and they match the province codes listed above. </p>

            <p class="p_2">It is important to review the log carefully for entries that pertain to HST. </p>

            <p class="p_2">Since the place of supply rules also apply to markups and discounts, when creating an additional booking record in an invoice for the markup/discount, agencies will need to create a Markup/Discount Vendor for each Province and link to the proper profile (containing the province code) accordingly so that the correct percentage is used to make the calculation.</p>
            <p class="p_2">For transactions with discounts/markups, where users are creating a separate booking in the invoice, a discount/markup vendor should be created for each Province with the Province field in the vendor profile populated for each province and also Canada in the Country field. The correct HST on Commission can then be calculated for these transactions.</p>

This is done by going to <span>Utilities|Global Defaults|Tax Related</span> and ensuring both XG (GST) and RC (HST) codes are captured in the GST Codes field. Separate them with a comma (XG,RC).

            <p class="p_2">The Quebec government has introduced a new Consumer Protection Fund, and the agency has to collect the fees. The Consumer must pay 35% or $3.50 on every thousand dollars in Travel. This charge must be represented as a separate line item on the client's invoice. For the first year the agency is allowed to keep 10% of the monies collected during the quarter and 3% after the first year. Setup and use for OPC:</p>
            <p class="p_2">1) Set up a new vendor. The name of the vendor optional, but one recommendation is OPC or OPC Fees. Enter an Interface ID, which could be OPCFEES.</p>
            <p class="p_2">2) Go to <span>General-Ledger|Accounts</span> and create a new 4xxx Sales account and a new 5xxx Cost of Sales account.</p>

            <p class="p_2">5) In order to create the new booking on the invoice, drive a manual accounting line for this fee at 0% commission so that the vendor collects the entire amount payable and there is no income earned.</p>
            <p class="p_2">6) At the end of the quarter send a check, along with the form, to the government. Deduct 10% which can then be taken as income.</p>
            <p class="p_2">(Please note that at this time BSP does not process these credit card charges for the agency. Since it has to appear as a separate item on the client's invoice, it cannot be included in the existing service fees. One option is to have each agent enter the charges to the point of sale machine for every invoice generated which might work in a very small agency but not be effective in an agency with any kind of volume.)</p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Note:</span> Both IATS (TicketMaster), CSI (Card Services International, and Pinnacle Payment Solutions (formerly PRI) are willing to handle the OPC Fund charges provided the agency gives them their service fee business as well.

            <p class="p_2">As of April 2004, Air Canada began paying commissions via credit memos, which are processed through BSP. These are the recommended steps agencies should follow to properly account for these transactions. </p>
            <p class="p_2">1) Create the invoice in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> either via interface or manual entry. The issue date will reflect the actual date of the sale: </p>

            <p class="p_2">2) On the Monday after the BSP Canada Web sale, BSP will e-mail the Web Cash Reward report and Web Account file. </p>
            <p class="p_2">3) When receiving the BSP Report, it will list the credit memo, and at that time create an adjustment Invoice in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> (<span>Invoices|Adjustments</span>, or Debit/Credit Memo) - one booking record for each confirmation number.</p>
            <p class="p_51">* Client name on the invoice = Air Canada </p>

            <p class="p_2">4) Perform the BSP Settlement as usual.</p>
            <p class="p_2">5) Run a Vendor Statement Summary report (<span>Reports|Vendor|Statement</span>) and compare this to the Credit Memo from Air Canada. This serves as a reconciliation process to ensure that the proper commissions were received from Air Canada on the Credit Memo.</p>
            <p class="p_51">* Report type = Summary </p>
            <p class="p_51">* Vendor Name = Air Canada </p>
            <p class="p_51">* From and To dates = BSP reporting period </p>
            <p class="p_2">6) Write off the Vendor Balance on the Vendor Balance Report created from Step 1. Go to <span>Payments|Received</span> after determining the amount of write-off based on the reconciliation process in Step 5. Enter the amount in the amount field of the payment received screen with a Pay Method = Other; Payment Date = BSP Settlement Date; Profile Type = Vendor Supplier; and Name = Air Canada. Toggle closed invoices that were paid by the Credit Memo from Air Canada and journalize to BSP Adjustments. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Note:</span> Agent Statements will be affected by the write-off of the Vendor Balance, as this is a Supplier CC transaction and should be set to Vendor Payment Date. </p>
