            <p class="p_2">Profiles are source records for statements and mailing lists for customer and vendors. Profiles store information about individuals and companies with whom the agency does business and are generally defined as “billing entities.” Think of the profile as <span class="span_1">ledger cards</span> in a manual system. When entering invoices or payments, <span class="span_1">Profiles</span> eliminate the need to re-key data. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Create Profiles manually, or capture them via interface from the GDS. (See the Interface Section for GDS entries required to capture profile information.) <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>recommends that if creating a new profile manually, create it from the <span class="span_1">Query</span> screen. This minimizes the possibility of having duplicate profiles in the database. By using the first few letters of the last name in the query screen, any profiles beginning with those letters are displayed. At a glance, determine if the profile already exists in the system. If the system finds no match, click on the <span class="span_1">New</span> tab and complete the fields for the new profile. The only mandatory field for a profile is the last name field. </p>
            <p class="p_2">If certain the profile does not already exist in the system, create a new profile by going to the <span class="span_1">Profile</span> main menu. Select the type of profile to enter, <span class="span_1">Leisure, Corporate, Vendor, Agent </span>or <span class="span_1">Other </span>and complete the information fields<span class="span_1">.</span> The more fields completed, the greater the opportunities become for future target marketing. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span class="span_1">Tip: </span>Although profiles can be created during Interface, they are NOT updated automatically. View any changes received during Interface in the Processing Error Log.</p>

            <h2><a name="Leisure_Client_Profiles" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Leisure_Client_Profiles"></a><a name="kanchor84"></a>Leisure Client Profiles</h2>
            <p class="p_2">When creating a leisure profile, consider who is responsible for payment. (We recommend one profile per paying party.) Build a profile for each billing party who purchases (or may purchase) travel from the agency. Each <span class="span_3">invoice</span> entered must link to an existing <span class="span_3">client</span> profile. Review the listing of fields below to get familiar with the data that exists in the profiles.</p>

If NO commission amount or rate was specified in the PNR, then the rate entered in the Vendor Profile,% Commission field is used.

            <p class="p_2">A Vendor Profile should be built for each vendor the agency wants to track. (See the Interface Download chapter about creating the Interface ID through the Interface process.) For commission tracking purposes, “Hotel” profiles should be built for each hotel location. </p>

            <p class="p_2"><span class="span_1">Query</span> retrieves an existing (or a previously entered) profile. Enter the query screen by either selecting <span>Profile|Query</span> from the main menu or using the Profile tab at the bottom of the screen. The query screen is broken into two sections. The top section is used to enter the data for the query and the bottom section displays the results of the query. The fields displayed in the top section show how a profile/s can be found. Each of these fields are fields within a profile and can be used to locate that profile again. As few as none and as many as all can be completed to retrieve a profile. </p>
            <p>The more criteria entered in a query, the more selective the search for matching invoices. The most frequently used query fields show on the General tab and additional fields are found in the Advanced tab. Enter the criteria available (or applicable) and the system brings up a complete listing of profiles matching that criteria. </p>
            <p class="p_2">To the right of some of the fields are drop-downs with selection options or operators. </p>

            <p class="p_2">These operators help to more narrowly define the search. (When doing searches on fields containing “wildcard” search criteria using the selections of “IN” and “NOT IN," the field must contain the complete string entered between the delimiters or the exact match). In other words, In and Not In works like Is Equal to or Is Not Equal to except that the list of values when using In and Not in when separated by a comma will search for each value in the list. The entire text would need to match exactly for Is Equal to or Is Not Equal to.</p>
