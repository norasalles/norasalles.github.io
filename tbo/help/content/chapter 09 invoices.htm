            <p class="p_2">Invoices are the daily records of sales and refunds, and are the main source of information for the system. Sales, Refund, Vouchers and Adjustment invoices are entered, queried, retrieved, modified and voided in the Invoice section of <span class="span_1">Trams </span>Back Office. Invoices are entered into <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>either through the interface process, by entering them into ClientBase, or by manual entry. If the agency interfaces, an interface record is created each time an agent drives a ticket or an invoice. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Specific accounting, client, vendor and booking information from the interface record is downloaded to <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> and becomes available for accounting, tracking and reporting needs. Once the downloaded invoices have been received and processed by <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>, modifications can be made manually to all of the fields except the Record Number which is computer assigned. (For more information on interfacing, see the Interface Guide located at <span>Start|Programs|Trams Back Office|TFW Interface</span>.)</p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Important Note:</span> Trams accepts an invoice number range of 0 to 2147483647. Anything higher will NOT be accepted either manually or via the Interface.</p>
            <p class="p_2">Invoices in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> are made up of three parts: The General Invoice Information, the Individual Booking Details, and the Booking Summary Screen. General invoice information includes information pertaining to the entire invoice, such as Invoice Number, Client Name, and Issue Date. Booking Details contain specific details of a booking, such as Airline or Vendor, Ticket or Confirmation Number, Fares and Commissions. The Booking Summary screen includes a list of all bookings entered along with Invoice Totals.</p>
            <p class="p_2">When manually building an invoice in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>, first enter the general invoice information, then enter each booking.</p>

            <p class="p_2">The Sale, Refund and Adjustment (Debit/Credit Memos) screens are combined into one screen that can be accessed by clicking <span>Invoice|Sale or Refund or Adjustment.</span> When the <span class="span_1">New</span> Button is selected from the Invoice Query Screen, access the “all-in-one” invoice screen, as well. The screen is defaulted for a <span class="span_1">Sale Invoice</span>. From this single screen change the <span class="span_1">Invoice Type</span> to a “Refund Invoice” or “Adjustment Invoice” (Debit/Credit Memos).</p>
            <p class="p_2">All the invoice screens are non-modal, meaning that one can click off the screens and go do another task in the program without closing the invoice screen. It is saved in the File Menu under <span class="span_1">Window</span>, and can be reopened to the same invoice screen.</p>

To calculate the true net remit amount, the commission amount field is reduced by the amount of the discount, and if the commission rate field is populated, the rate is removed and the commission amount is reduced by the amount of the discount. This reflects the correct net remit on the Expanded Fare Tab and on the Vendor Balance report. It also correctly reflects the revenue earned on the booking as part of the commission is given back to the customer through the discount.</p>

            <p class="p_2">UDID’s (User Definable Interface Data) are pieces of information attached to a booking for reporting purposes. They are stored in the invoice booking screen and accessed through the UDID’s tab at the top of the screen. Click on <span class="span_1">UDID’s</span> to display the table. There are 999 UDID fields. Each field has capacity for 128 alphanumeric characters (if using the GDS, the capacity is 60 alphanumeric characters). </p>

            </p>
            <p class="p_2">For reporting purposes, UDID’s can define categories for each booking, giving access to information which may be important for clients and to customer service — as well as, the agency database. By listing the UDID’s in a table, they are easier to read and input and they are separated from the client remarks field. UDID’s can contain both negative and positive dollar values which are added together in the report generator. </p>

                <li value="2">Blank *UU values will not clear or delete existing UDID values.</li>
                <li value="3">UDIDs will only be updated if both the *HU and *UU values exist.</li>
                <li value="4">*UU will work for all GDS and will work the same way *HU works today (by issuing an itinerary, not an invoice).</li>

                    <p>It is not possible to mix regular UDID entries and UU overrides in the same record. When updating a hotel or car, issue the standard HU itinerary (with the original UDIDs) then if UDID entries need to be updated add the *UU entries and drive a new itinerary.</p>

            <p class="p_2">There is a <span class="span_1">Split Booking</span> option in the Invoice Screen (via the right-click menu on the booking list). Bookings can be split if <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> is <span class="span_1">Supplier</span> and both Client and Vendor status are open. This means a single booking can more easily be split into multiple bookings for applying partial Credit Card payments on an invoice or creating a CC discount. By using the <span class="span_1">Split Booking</span> option instead of the <span class="span_1">Copy</span> button, the total value of the invoice and total commission on the invoice is not allowed to be changed. </p>
            <p class="p_2">The <span class="span_1">Split Booking</span> option also works on invoices in a closed period. When initiating the <span class="span_1">Split Booking</span> option, only a TF field is available for entry. The TF for the booking being added to the invoice will reduce the amount of the TF in the original booking. Any commission on the booking to be split would remain with the original booking, and only a TF will be in the new split booking. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Example</span>:</p>
            <p class="p_2">- Invoice Total for single booking invoice with Carnival is $2000.00 with a commission of $200.00</p>
            <p class="p_2">- Customer makes a $500.00 CC payment on the invoice.</p>

            <p class="p_2">With <span class="span_1">Query,</span> retrieve an existing (or a previously entered) invoice. The query screen is broken into two sections. The top section is used to enter the data for the query and the bottom section displays the results of the query. The fields displayed in the top section show how an invoice/s can be found. Each of these fields are fields within the invoice and can be used to locate that invoice again. As few as none and as many as all can be completed to retrieve an invoice. </p>
            <p class="p_2">The more criteria entered in Query, the more selective the search for matching invoices. The most frequently used query fields show on the General tab and additional fields are found in the advanced tab. Enter the selection criteria, click <span class="span_1">Query, </span>and the system brings up a complete listing of invoices matching that criteria. </p>
            <p class="p_2">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 1 welcome/invoices_12.jpg" style="height: 117px;width: 136px;" class="img_1" /> </p>
            <p class="p_2">To the right of the Invoice, Acctg, Client and Vendor Remarks fields is a separate field with selection options or operators, <span class="span_1">Is Equal To, Is Not Equal To, Is Blank, Is Not Blank, Starting With, Contains, In, and Not In</span>. These operators can more narrowly define the search. (When doing searches on fields containing “wildcard” search criteria using the selections of “IN” and “NOT IN," this is a search for the field to contain the complete string entered between the delimiters or the exact match). In other words, <span>In </span>and<span> Not In </span>works like<span> Is Equal to </span>or <span>Is Not Equal to</span> except that the list of values when using <span>In </span>and <span>Not In</span> when separated by a comma will search for each value in the list. The entire text would need to match exactly for <span>Is Equal to </span>or <span>Is Not Equal to.</span></p>
            <p class="p_2">For example, if the only criteria entered into the Query screen is the <span class="span_1">Invoice Type of Sale</span>, a listing of all Sales Invoices is displayed, in issue-date order. If, in addition to the Invoice Type, a portion of the Ticket Number is entered into the Query fields, the list is narrowed further and only Sales Invoices with Ticket Numbers matching that criteria are included. This allows for quick retrieval by Invoice Number or by Issue Date.</p>
            <p class="p_2"><span>Note:</span><span class="span_1">The Payment No field on the Invoice Query window only applies to Client and Vendor Payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="p_58">ADVANCED TAB:</p>
            <p class="p_21">
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 1 welcome/invoices_13.jpg" style="height: 219px;width: 551px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p class="p_2">The Invoice query advanced tab provides even more fields for searches. For example, there is check box entitled <span class="span_1">Invoiced in ClientBase</span>. When checked, invoices generated in ClientBase would be displayed on the query screen. There is also a Department field (can be added to query columns) and Depart City Arrive City fields for search capabilities. (<span>Note:</span> To avoid performance issues (especially with large databases), the recommendation is to include additional query parameters (such as Issue or Depart date ranges or a Client Name, etc.). The itinerary field was added to the query results column options when in view by booking mode. If using the origin/destination fields in conjunction with Depart dates, recommendation is to leave the Depart date to field blank as adding the Depart to date may cause no results to be returned.)</p>

            <p class="p_2">Buttons on the right side of the query screen are also broken into two sections. <span class="span_1">Query, Reset, Count, Sort by, Columns,View by Booking/View by Invoice, </span>and <span class="span_1">Default, </span>are buttons related to the query. Use the <span class="span_1">Reset</span> button to clear away any previous query criteria. This clears both the General and Advanced tab. <span class="span_1">Count</span> is used to give the number of items that match the query criteria. <span class="span_1">Sort By</span> tells the query screen how to display the results once the query is executed. </p>
            <p class="p_2"><span class="span_1">Columns </span>is used to select which columns of data are displayed in the results screen. Click <span class="span_1">Columns</span> and choose the columns to display by highlighting the column in the <span class="span_1">Available Fields</span> and clicking on the left arrow to move it over to <span class="span_1">Displayed Fields</span>. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Using the red up and down arrows, put the column in the order to appear on the results screen. Go out to the results screen and size the columns. Go back into <span class="span_1">Columns</span> and click <span class="span_1">Save Settings </span>and <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save. Next sort the columns by 3 sorts in ascending and descending order. When completed, make sure to click <span class="span_1">Save Settings</span>. </p>
            <p class="p_2">Drag and drop the columns to re-position them on the results screen if desired. Do this by clicking on the column to move, holding down the left mouse button, and sliding the column to any position on the query screen. To place a column to the right or left of any existing column, stop on the column to the right or left and release the mouse. The moved column is inserted in the correct place. Click <span class="span_1">Columns</span> and click <span class="span_1">Save Settings</span> and <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save.</p>
            <p class="p_2"><span class="span_1">View by Invoice/View by Booking </span>is a toggle button. When <span class="span_1">View by Invoice</span> is clicked<span class="span_1">, </span>invoices are displayed, but clicking it again changes this to <span class="span_1">View by Booking. </span>This displays bookings only, and the <span class="span_1">Columns </span>button has many new booking level fields for display that are not under the <span class="span_1">Column</span> button when <span class="span_1">View by Invoice</span> is selected. </p>
            <p class="p_2">When <span class="span_1">View By Booking</span> is shown on the button, the view is at the Invoice Level, but if <span class="span_1">View By Invoice </span>is shown on the button, the view is at the Booking Level.</p>
            <p class="p_2">To save the filters in the query, use <span class="span_1">Default </span>and follow these directions to create a new Saved Query:</p>
            <p class="p_2">1. Change the selection criteria on the results screen for the new query to save.</p>
            <p class="p_2">2. Click <span class="span_1">Default</span>.</p>
            <p class="p_2">3. Type in the new query name in the <span class="span_1">Setting Name</span> field.</p>
            <p class="p_2">4. If this saved query is the default, at the top of the drop-down window, check <span class="span_1">Set As Default</span>.</p>
            <p class="p_2">5. Select <span class="span_1">Per User</span> (on the user’s own workstation only) or Global (on everyone’s sets).</p>
            <p class="p_2">6. Click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save.</p>
            <p class="p_2">To remove a saved query from the list, check the <span class="span_1">Remove the Current Named Setting</span> box, click <span class="span_1">OK </span>and the saved query is no longer available for use in the drop down field. </p>
            <p class="p_2">On the Invoice Query Screen, use &lt;Shift&gt;, left-mouse click for selecting a range of items for closing, deleting, or printing, etc. Using &lt;CTRL&gt;, left-mouse click selects multiple individual items in any order for closing, deleting, etc.</p>

            <p>Air Canada pays commissions via credit memos, which are processed through BSP. These are the recommended steps agencies should follow to properly account for these transactions. </p>
            <p>1) Create the invoice in <span class="span_1">Trams</span><span class="span_1">Back Office</span> either via interface or manual entry. The issue date will reflect the actual date of the sale: </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Submit to = Supplier (Comm Track invoices would not account for sales/cost of sales in the general ledger) </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Total Fare = Amount of ticket </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Commission = Amount of commission earned on the ticket </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Form of Payment = Credit card </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Sales Agent(s) = Sales Agent(s) in PNR </p>
            <p>2) On the Monday after the BSP Canada Web sale, BSP will e-mail a Web Cash Reward report and Web Account file. </p>
            <p>3) Upon receiving the BSP Report, it will list the credit memo, and at that time be sure to create an Adjustment Invoice in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> (<span>Invoices|Adjustments</span>, or Debit/Credit Memo) - one booking record for each confirmation number.</p>
            <p class="p_59">* Client name on the invoice = Air Canada </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Vendor name on the invoice = Air Canada </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Memo number in the invoice = Credit memo number </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Original Ticket number in the invoice = Credit memo number </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Do not enter any Sales Agents to the credit memo as they were already tagged when the supplier invoice was created in Step 1 </p>
            <p>4) Perform the BSP Settlement as usual.</p>
            <p>5) Run a Vendor Statement Summary report (<span>Reports|Vendor|Statement</span>) and compare this to the Credit Memo from Air Canada. This serves as a reconciliation process to ensure that the proper commissions were received from Air Canada on the Credit Memo.</p>
            <p class="p_59">* Report type = Summary </p>
            <p class="p_59">* Vendor Name = Air Canada </p>
            <p class="p_59">* From and To dates = BSP reporting period </p>
            <p>6) Write off the Vendor Balance on the Vendor Balance Report created from Step 1. Go to <span>Payments|Received</span> after determining the amount of write-off based on the reconciliation process in Step 5. Enter the amount in the amount field of the payment received screen with a Pay Method = Other; Payment Date = BSP Settlement Date; Profile Type = Vendor Supplier; and Name = Air Canada. Toggle closed invoices that were paid by the Credit Memo from Air Canada and journalize to BSP Adjustments. </p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> Agent Statements will be affected by the write-off of the Vendor Balance, as this is a Supplier CC transaction and should be set to Vendor Payment Date. </p>

            <p>If adding a finance charge for any invoices remaining open longer than, perhaps, 30 days, there is now a way of keeping the finance charge portion of open invoices separate from the original invoice. Create a separate <span class="span_1">finance charge invoice</span> for any money owed by, effectively separating the original charge from the finance charge. This feature adds finance charges to any client's account that appears on the Client Balance Core Report.</p>

            <p>Managing groups and keeping the accounting organized can be challenging, due to the number of transactions taking place, and more importantly, due to the lack of a relationship between the amounts collected and amounts paid out. Although each group is different, here is an example of handling a group situation. Most agencies, when dealing with a group, account for Sales or Income once the entire group is complete or the group has departed. </p>
            <p>The simplest way to determine the profit earned on a group is to calculate the difference between what is collected from client for the group and what is paid out to vendors for the group. Keeping this concept in mind, here is a way of handling groups in <span class="span_1">Trams.</span></p>
            <p>1. Although the profit is calculated for the group as a whole, the payments need to be tracked for each client. Thus, each client traveling in the group must have a separate Client Profile in <span class="trams">Trams</span>. First create a Client Group (i.e. SKI’12) under <span>Utilities|Setup|Groups</span>. (See <span class="span_1">Creating Group Identifiers</span> in the <span class="span_1">Profile</span> chapter.)</p>
            <p>2. Next, in each client’s profile click the Groups tab, then select the client group created in step 1. This ties all of these profiles together for reporting purposes later, such as printing mailing labels for the group.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 1 welcome/invoices_30.jpg" style="height: 384px;width: 500px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>3. Even if the vendor is already set up in <span class="trams">Trams</span><span class="span_29">,</span> or there are multiple vendors involved, build a single Vendor Profile for the group. Make the vendor name descriptive<span class="span_1"> e</span>.g<span class="span_1">.</span><span class="span_1">Ski Group-Winter 12</span>.</p>
            <p>4. Next, create an <span>Invoice|Payment Group</span> (i.e. SKI’12) under <span>Utilities|Setup|Groups</span>. (See Creating Group Identifiers in Profile chapter.)</p>
            <p>5. When any group payments are received from clients, enter the <span class="span_1">Payment Received</span> as usual. Make sure to click the arrow next to the <span class="span_1">Payment</span><span class="span_1">Group</span> field and select the Invoice/Payment Group name that was created in Step 4. When prompted, create a voucher for the payment.</p>
            <p>6. To see how much has been collected so far, print a <span class="span_1">Group Client Statement</span>, in <span>Reports|Client|Statement</span>. In the report screen change <span class="span_1">Report Type</span> to <span class="span_1">Summary</span>. Change the <span class="span_1">Format</span> to <span class="span_1">Group. </span>Click the Invoice Group field and select the <span>Invoice|Payment Group</span> name for the group. Also look at the <span class="span_1">Group Revenue Report</span> under <span>Report|Payments|Group Revenue</span>. No invoices have been created at this point.</p>
            <p>7. When any group payments are made to vendors, enter the <span class="span_1">Payment Made</span> to <span class="span_1">Vendor-Supplier</span> and point to the Vendor profile name for the group. (Enter the actual Payee in the Name on Check field.) Make sure to click the arrow next to the <span class="span_1">Payment</span><span class="span_1">Group</span> field and select the Invoice|Payment Group name that was created in Step 4. When prompted, create a voucher for the payment.</p>
            <p>8. At any time see how much has been paid out to vendors for the group, by printing a <span class="span_1">Vendor Statement</span> in <span>Reports|Vendor|Statement </span>for the Vendor profile name for the group. Also look at the <span class="span_1">Group Revenue Report</span> under <span>Report|Payments|Group Revenue</span>. <span>Note:</span> When viewing the Current Group Profit amount on the Group Revenue report, the cost of any tickets (amount that passed on to ARC/BSP for the tickets) needs to be subtracted from this total.</p>
            <p>9. Issue invoices for any <span class="span_1">ARC</span> documents for the group as is done for individual business, so they will appear on the ARC report. Make sure to click the arrow next to the <span class="span_1">Group</span> field on the invoice screen and select the <span>Invoice|Payment Group</span> name that was created in Step 4. </p>
            <p>10. Next, Query the ARC invoices and click the <span class="span_1">Refund</span> button to refund. Change the <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> field to <span class="span_1">Supplier</span> and <span class="span_1">Vendor</span> to the vendor profile name for the group. Then enter a zero payment received from the client and close the ARC invoice and the refund invoice. Make sure to click the arrow next to the <span class="span_1">Payment</span><span class="span_1">Group</span> field and select the <span>Invoice|Payment Group</span> name that was created in Step 4.</p>
            <p>11. Wait to issue any <span class="span_1">non-ARC</span> invoices until the group is completed and the sales and income are to be accounted for.</p>
            <p>12. When the group is completed, enter a separate invoice for each client for the total amount collected from that client. Set the <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> field (on the invoice) to <span class="span_1">Supplier</span> and specify the vendor profile for this group. Enter the total amount collected as the <span class="span_1">Total Fare</span> and set the <span class="span_1">Commission/Rate</span> field to zero.</p>
            <p>13. After all invoices are entered, the client balances are zero and the profit on the group is available in the vendor account on the Vendor Balances report or Vendor Statement. The invoice total reflects the difference between what has been collected and what has been paid out. Therefore, the balance reflects the profit for the group.</p>
            <p>14. The last step is to transfer the profit amount from the vendor's balance to Income. Enter a <span class="span_1">Sales Invoice</span> date as the date on which to account for the income. Point to the appropriate <span class="span_1">Sales Agent</span>, if applicable. Enter the client name. Set the <span class="span_1">Submit To</span> field to <span class="span_1">Supplier</span> and specify the Vendor profile for this group. The <span class="span_1">Total Fare</span> is left at zero. Enter the profit amount determined in Step 13 as the <span class="span_1">Commission/Rate</span> and click the <span class="span_1">OK</span> button to save the invoice. This entry increases the income by the amount entered, zeros the vendor balance and updates sales agent's statement.</p>
            <p><span>Note:</span> All client and vendor balances are now zero, but vouchers and open invoices still appear. To apply these balances and clear the accounts, enter a payment for each with the amount set to zero and <span class="span_1">close</span> all invoices and vouchers.
