            <p>The <span class="trams">Trams</span> Back Office system includes a fully integrated General Ledger. Because the General Ledger is a direct by-product of the Four Core Reports, its successful implementation in <span class="trams">Trams Back Office </span>is key. This chapter outlines using the General Ledger in <span class="trams">Trams Back Office</span>.</p>
            <p>The General Ledger is active the day the first invoice or payment is entered in <span class="trams">Trams Back Office</span>. The system makes it easy by automatically recording all the journal entries associated with every invoice, refund, client payment made or received, vendor payments made or received, and ARC/BSP settlement payments. <span class="trams_1">Trams Back Office </span><span>sends these journal entries to the general ledger with one routine called “End of Period.” </span>Learn more about the End of Period journal entries in this chapter. The only journal entries not included in the End of Period routine are those associated with bank withdrawals, and payments received or made using a Profile Type or Pay Method of “Other.” These types of transactions require journal entries transaction by transaction.</p>
            <p>What follows is a basic overview on integrating the invoice and payment entries into the General Ledger. These procedures are only recommendations, and are designed to be simple and basic. An accountant is still recommended for review, adjustments, taxes and year-end closings. Any variations (and the level of detail) are entirely up to each agency and the user’s level of experience with accounting. It’s a good idea to confirm decisions with the agency’s accountant.</p>
            <h2><a name="Query_-_Retrieving_an_Existing_JE" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Query_-_Retrieving_an_Existing_JE" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="kanchor228"></a><span class="Heading2Char">Query</span> - Retrieving an Existing JE</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 1 welcome/query retrieving an existing_516x386.png" style="width: 516;height: 386;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p />
            <p>Using Query, retrieve a previously entered journal entry. The fields displayed above identify the criteria by which a journal entry can be located. Use each of these fields captured within a journal entry to locate a journal entry. The more criteria entered in Query, the more selective the search for matching journal entries becomes. Enter the criteria available or applicable and the system provides a complete listing of journal entries matching that criteria.</p>
            <p>For example, if the only criteria entered into the Query screen is the Journal Entry Type of End of Period, a listing of all End of Period journal entries ever created is displayed in the order they were created by JE number for selecting. If, in addition to the Journal Entry Type, an Activity Date is completed, then the list is narrowed and only includes End of Period journal entries created within that time frame.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold_arial">NOTES</strong><span class="span_1">:</span> </p>
            <p>Activity Date and Posting Date automatically default the To field to whatever is entered into the From field. This allows for quick retrieval by Date, or enter ranges.</p>
            <p>To query by a debit or credit amount range, enter a range in the <span class="span_1">Amount from and to.</span></p>
            <p>To the right of the <span class="span_1">Remarks</span> field is a separate field with selection options or operators: Is Equal To, Is Not Equal To, Is Blank, Is Not Blank, Starting With, Contains, In, and Not In. These operators help to more narrowly define the search. (When doing searches on fields containing “wildcard” search criteria using the selections of “IN” and “NOT IN," it is desired for the field to contain the complete string entered between the delimiters or the exact match). In other words, In and Not In works like Is Equal to or Is Not Equal to except that the list of values when using In and Not In when separated by a comma will search for each value in the list. The entire text would need to match exactly for Is Equal to or Is Not Equal to.</p>
            <p>Buttons on the right side of the screen are also broken into two sections. <span class="span_1">Query, Reset, Count, Sort by, Columns</span>, <span class="span_1">View Detail </span>and <span class="span_1">Default</span> are </p>
            <p>
                <img src="resources/images/chapter 1 welcome/query retrieving an existing.jpg" style="height: 241px;width: 115px;" class="img_1" />
            </p>
            <p><span class="span_1">Reset</span> clears away any previous query criteria in the General and Advanced tab.</p>
            <p><span class="span_1">Count</span> gives the number of items that match the query criteria.</p>
            <p><span class="span_1">Columns</span> is used to select which columns of data to display in the results screen. Click <span class="span_1">Columns</span> and choose the columns displayed by highlighting the column in the <span class="span_1">Available Fields</span> and clicking the left arrow to move it over to <span class="span_1">Displayed Fields</span>. Using the red up and down arrows, put the column in the order wanted to appear on the results screen. Click <span class="span_1">Save Settings </span>and <span class="span_1">OK. </span>Go to the results screen and size the columns. Go back into <span class="span_1">Columns, </span>click <span class="span_1">Save Settings </span>and <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save (make sure to select sorts before saving).</p>
            <p><span class="span_1">Drag and drop the columns</span> to re-position them on the results screen if desired. Do this by clicking on the column to move, holding down the left mouse button, and sliding the column to any position on the query screen. To place a column to the right or left of any existing column, stop on the column to the right or left and release the mouse. The moved column is inserted in the correct place. Go into <span class="span_1">Columns, </span>click <span class="span_1">Save Settings </span>and <span class="span_1">OK </span>to save.</p>
            <p><span class="span_1">View Detail </span>is similar to how the button works in the invoice query screen, when View Detail is selected, the details of each journal entry screen are now displayed in the query results grid. The query results default to the traditional summary view, when the view detail button is clicked the results changes to list each item in journal entry separately.</p>
            <p><span class="span_1">Default </span>is where to save queries and filters in the query following these directions:</p>
            <p>1. Change the selection criteria on the results screen for the new query to save.</p>
            <p>2. Click <span class="span_1">Default</span>.</p>
            <p>3. Type in the new query name in the <span class="span_1">Setting Name</span> field.</p>
            <p>4. If this saved query is the default, at the top of the drop-down window, check <span class="span_1">Set As Default</span>.</p>
            <p>5. Select <span class="span_1">Per User</span> (on this one workstation only) or Global (on everyone’s sets).</p>
            <p>6. Click <span class="span_1">OK</span> to save.</p>
            <p>To remove a saved query from the list, check the <span class="span_1">Remove the Current Named Setting</span> box, click <span class="span_1">OK </span>and the saved query is no longer available for use in the drop down field.</p>
            <p>Once the listing of matching journal entries is displayed through Query, any journal entry can be added <span class="span_1">(New)</span>, viewed <span class="span_1">(View)</span>, copied<span class="span_1"> (Copy),</span> printed (<span class="span_1">Print JE) </span>or (<span class="span_1">Print Query) or </span>voided <span class="span_1">(Void)</span>.</p>

            <p>To select a Journal Entry to view or modify, once the listing of matching journal entries is displayed on the screen, either double click the item or highlight the appropriate journal entry and click <span class="span_1">View</span>. <strong class="bold_arial">Note</strong>: If the journal entry was created from within a payment entry, <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>suggests retrieving the payment to view the journal entry.</p>
            <p><span>Tip: </span>Use Ctrl-PgDn/Ctrl-PgUp to access next or previous payment.</p>

            <p>By clicking <span class="span_1">View, </span>edit a Journal Entry remark and click <span class="span_1">Update. </span>Multiple remarks can be updated simultaneously (provided the same remark applies to multiple journal entry line items. Select multiple lines in the J/E screen at once by using Control/Click or Shift/Click. When multiple lines are selected, all of the fields at the top of the screen except Remarks and Detail Group are disabled. After entering a remark and/or a detail group, pressing update will update all of the selected line items. When only one line is selected, the screen works as it does now, and the global modify button is disabled.<br /></p>

            <p>To copy information from an existing journal entry as defaults into a new journal entry, highlight the appropriate journal entry to be copied, and click <span class="span_1">Copy</span>. The system displays a new journal entry record with all defaults completed from the copied journal entry. </p>
            <p><strong class="bold_arial">Tip</strong><span>:</span> The date does not default to the copied journal entry's date but instead defaults to the <span class="span_3">system</span> date. Add, change or delete any of the journal entry lines by highlighting the line, making the change, and electing <span class="span_1">Add, Update, </span>or<span class="span_1"> Delete</span>. This shortcut may come in handy for quickly entering recurring journal entries, such as depreciation tables and budgets. If combined with the ability to Query by Journal Entry code, recurring journal entries are quickly captured into <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span>.</p>

            <h3><a name="Invoices" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Invoices" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Invoices</h3>
            <p>One purpose for entering invoices into <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>is to maintain sales figures which are reflected in a report called the<span class="span_1"> Invoice Activity Report</span>. Sales and Cost of Sales (or Gross and Net) are reflected on the Invoice Activity Report and are printed for any specified period. Another reason for entering Invoices into <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> is to create the Client, Vendor and ARC/BSP Balances passed through the agency as a result of these Sales and Cost of Sales. The Client Balances are created from the Total Fare or Sales figure and the vendor and/or ARC/BSP Balances are created from the Net Fare or Cost of Sale.</p>
            <p>Instead of updating Sales, Cost of Sales, Client, Vendor and ARC/BSP Balance accounts within the General Ledger each time an invoice is entered, <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>updates these accounts once through the “End of Period” journal entry. Therefore, during the period, invoices can be entered, modified, and voided with no effect on the General Ledger until the End of Period journal entry is created.</p>
            <p>In the world of accounting, there are always at least two GL Accounts to every journal entry. In the case of Invoices, the Total Fare updates the Sales accounts and Accounts Receivable (Client Balances) and the Net Fare updates the Cost of Sales accounts and the Accounts Payable (Vendor and/or ARC/BSP Balances). In the case of payments affecting the bank account, one side updates the bank balance and the other side is a General Ledger account which indicates the description of the payment itself (what it was for).</p>

            <p>In Trams Back Office, there are five types of payments received and made. Selecting the <span class="span_1">Profile Type</span> when entering a payment determines which reports will be affected. </p>

            <p>Any payments entered with a Profile Type of Other or Pay Method of <span class="span_1">Other</span> triggers a prompt to complete the journal entry (journalized by transaction). The payment type of <span class="span_1">Withdrawal</span> is also journalized by transaction.

            <p><span>IMPORTANT!</span> Because the End of Period journal entry is a summarized posting of the total balance from the Four Core Reports (Client Balances, Vendor Balances, ARC/BSP Balances and Check Register), the key to creating an accurate End of Period journal entry is to first verify that the detail contained on each of the Core Reports are accurate. If any of the four Core reports is not accurate, the End of Period Journal entry will also be inaccurate. </p>

            <p>Invoices affect Sales/Cost of sales in the Income Statement. The submit to field and travel type fields in each invoice determine what effect will take place through an End of Period posting. Payments received and made (for all profile types except Other and Payment Methods of Other) affect Accounts Receivables (Client Balances) and Accounts Payables (Vendor Balances) through the End of Period posting. Profile type of Other and Pay method of Other prompt for a journal entry and hit the General Ledger automatically.</p>

            <p>The <span class="italic_1">End of Period</span> journal entry is created automatically when the user decides it’s time to create it by selecting <span>General Ledger|End of Period</span>. The system checks various management reports and takes the totals from those reports to create one large journal entry. This Journal Entry summarizes <span class="span_1">Sales, Client and Vendor Receipts and Disbursements</span>, and <span class="span_1">ARC/BSP payments</span> for the period. This journal entry eliminates the need to create separate journal entries for <span class="span_1">Invoices, Client and Vendor Payments</span>, and <span class="span_1">ARC/BSP payments</span>. </p>
            <p>An <span class="span_1">End of Period</span> creates a single journal entry updating all <span class="span_1">Sales, Cost of Sales, Commission Income, Client Balances, Vendor Balances, ARC/BSP Balances</span> and <span class="span_1">Cash in Bank</span> General Ledger accounts based on invoice, client and vendor payments, and ARC/BSP payments created during the period. The first time the <span class="span_1">End of Period</span> is created, the system prompts for both <span class="span_1">From</span> and <span class="span_1">To</span> dates. All future <span class="span_1">End of Period</span> entries prompt only for a <span class="span_1">To</span> date, because the <span class="span_1">From</span> date is one day greater than the prior period's <span class="italic_1">To</span> date.</p>
            <p>I<strong class="bold_arial">mportant Note: Although the End of Period creates a journal entry, as with any other journal entry entered into Trams Back Office, it is not posted to the General Ledger until the Posting routine is processed. See the section on Posting.</strong></p>
            <p>Once creating an <span class="italic_1">End of Period</span> for a given month or accounting period, <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office </span>prohibits invoice or payment inputs or modifications within that period. As a result, any report can be printed, at any time, providing a detailed history (or audit trail) of figures used to create any <span class="italic_1">End of Period</span> Journal Entry. <span class="italic_1">Journal Entries, Bank Deposits,</span> and <span class="italic_1">Bank Withdrawals</span> can still be entered within the period.</p>
            <p>To see a list of <span class="italic_1">End of Period</span> entries, print a <span class="italic_1">Journal Entry Analysis</span> report for <span class="italic_1">End of Period </span>entries.</p>
            <p>If an <span class="italic_1">End of Period</span> entry is created in error or if corrections need to be made to invoices or payments, the <span class="italic_1">End of Period</span> can be voided. (See <span class="span_1">Voiding an End of Period.)</span></p>

Multiusers who are using TBO while a Full End of Period is being performed, receive a message warning them that they are locked out of the payment, invoice, etc. until the Full End of Period is completed.

            <p><span>Step 1:</span> Select a start date which should be at the beginning of an accounting period.</p>
            <p><span>Step 2:</span> Verify that the accounting period prior to the start date is in balance and that the period is posted. </p>

            <p>In order to maintain an accurate audit trail within the General Ledger, a routine is performed monthly to lock in any journal entries made to date so they can no longer be changed or voided. This routine is called <span class="italic_1">Posting your Journal Entries</span><sup class="sup_1">.</sup> Until a journal entry is posted it can be changed or voided, even the End of Period journal entry. </p>
            <p><strong class="bold_arial">Note</strong>: <span>Because of posting's permanent effect, this routine is performed with caution, and only after all Core reports are balanced and their corresponding General Ledger accounts are in sync; usually about the middle of the following month.</span> </p>
            <p>Once posted, all invoices, payments and journal entries for that period can no longer be changed or voided. However, journal entries can always be added to a posted period if an adjustment needs to be entered. Always process a Trial Balance report before posting, saying <span class="span_1">yes</span> to Pseudo Post to see the effects Posting will have.</p>
            <p>Much time is spent recording daily activities and balancing them. To protect from any future changes once everything is reflecting what it should, posting should be performed. Posting protects the agency from changes that may affect the financials and tax reporting. <span class="span_1">It does not, however prevent a journal entry from being added to a closed and posted period. </span>We therefore recommend that the creation of journal entries (General ledger/Journal entry) be limited to the person or persons in charge of the financials and be regulated by the use of individual logins. We would also recommend that printed copies of monthly financials be kept on file so that if changes have been made to closed periods they can be identified more easily for verification.</p>
            <p>It is also recommended that at the end of each month, run a Journal Entry Query with the <span class="span_1">Status</span> set as <span class="span_1">Unposted</span>. Run for an appropriate posted period, year-to-date of last posted period, last-year-to date of last posted period, etc., to view any unposted items that someone might have added or changed in a posted period. Then verify or delete those items, post them, and run new monthly financials to reflect the changes made. </p>

            <p><span>Step 1.</span> Check that the data in the IAR Sales Report matches data in <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> by one of three methods: </p>
            <p class="p_13"><span>a) Method One:</span> Run a list of all invoices captured in <span class="span_1">Trams</span> by going into <span>Reports|Invoice|Analysis</span> and verifying that all invoices for the week are accounted for in <span class="span_1">Trams</span>. Then, run a list of all tickets captured in <span class="span_1">Trams</span> by going into <span>Reports|Invoice|ARC/BSP Reconciliation</span> and verifying that all tickets issued for the week are accounted for in <span class="span_1">Trams</span>, and be sure to set ticket status to <span>ALL</span>. </p>
            <p class="p_13"><span>b) Method Two:</span> Download the IAR file from the IAR website. Go to <span>Reports|Invoice|IAR Reconciliation</span> and click the IAR File button to point to the path of the downloaded .txt file obtained from the IAR website. Print out an Exception Report which points out differences between what was submitted to IAR and <span class="span_1">Trams</span> Back Office. </p>
            <p class="p_13"><span>c) Method Three:</span> Download the IAR file from the IAR website. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- Go to <span>Payments|ARC Settlement</span>. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- Query for the week’s ARC tickets so they are displayed on the settlement screen. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- Click IAR Reconciliation on the ARC Settlement screen. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- Click IAR Filename and map to the weekly IAR file. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- Click Query to see the standard IAR Reconciliation Report. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- For tickets where <span class="span_1">Net Remit Do Not Match</span>, <span class="span_1">Ticket Is Voided in IAR but Not in Trams</span>, or <span class="span_1">Missing IAR Ticket</span>, click <span class="span_1">Find Ticket</span> and the cursor lands on the appropriate ticket on the ARC Settlement screen so <span class="span_1">Edit Invoice</span> appears as normal. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- For tickets that are <span class="span_1">Voided In Trams but Not In IAR</span>, click <span class="span_1">Find Ticket</span> to go to the booking containing that voided ticket in TBO, so it can be unvoided, allowing the ticket to now show correctly on the ARC Settlement Screen. </p>
            <p class="p_13">-- For any exceptions that are <span class="span_1">Missing Trams Ticket</span>, click off the IAR Reconciliation screen, and manually add the missing tickets. If doing this method, no need to do Steps 2 and 4 below. </p>
            <p class="p_13"><span>Note:</span> This is the same IAR Reconciliation exception report that was only available before under <span>Reports|Invoice|IAR Reconciliation</span>. The IAR Reconciliation from the ARC Settlement screen works the same way and provides that same exception report, but now has linking ability to the tickets displayed on the ARC Settlement Screen. </p>
            <p><span>Step 2.</span> Enter any missing Refunds, Debit Memos, Voids, etc. so <span class="span_1">Trams Back Office</span> agrees with IAR Sales Report. </p>
            <p><span>Step 3.</span> Enter and balance the ARC/BSP Settlement for the week under <span>Payments|ARC Settlement</span>. Do this by comparing the amount withdrawn to the amount <span class="span_1">Trams</span> calculated as the Net Remittance amount for that ARC/BSP week. If the two numbers do not balance exactly, review the ARC/BSP Settlement section of this manual. </p>
            <p><span>Step 4.</span> Submit the IAR Sales Report. </p>
            <p>If processing through ARC/IAR, complete the ARC Settlement right after submitting the IAR Sales Report. </p>

            <p>3. Submit BSP Link report through the Internet. If necessary, print the BSP Report (<span>Report|Invoice|BSP</span>), set the <span class="span_1">Included Items</span> to <span class="span_1">Manual,</span> and mail it to the area bank.</p>
            <p>4.

            <p>Once the bank statement and all ARC/BSP reports for the month are reconciled: </p>
            <p>1. Click <span>General Ledger|End of Period</span> and create the <span class="span_1">End of Period</span> journal entry.</p>
            <p>2. Print the <span class="span_1">Trial Balance Report</span>. (<span>Reports|General Ledger|Trial Balance</span>)</p>
            <p>3. Print the Management Summary Report and Note the balances for the following Core Report totals:</p>
            <p class="p_12">Client Balances </p>
            <p class="p_12">Vendor Balances </p>
            <p class="p_12">ARC Balances</p>
            <p class="p_12">Check Register</p>
            <p><span>Note: </span>There is a <span class="span_1">Total Base </span>column on this report, The yield percentage is the commission divided by total base.</p>
            <p>5. Each month, compare the <span class="span_1">Ending Balances</span> of all <span class="span_1">Core Reports</span> against the <span class="span_1">Trial Balance</span> Report. The Core Reports and the Trial Balance Report should balance <span class="span_3">to the penny</span><span class="span_1">before</span> posting occurs. If one or more of the Core Reports does not balance to the Trial Balance, print the <span class="span_1">GL Reconciliation</span><span class="span_1">Report</span>. </p>
            <p>a. Click <span>Reports|General Ledger|GL Reconciliation</span>.</p>
            <p>b. Although not every entry on this report needs to be cleared off, the report gives the best idea of why the Trial Balance is out of balance. Check each item’s warning message. (For warning definitions see the manual under <span>Reports|General Ledger|GL Reconciliation Report</span>.) To make corrections, Void the End of Period first. </p>
            <p>c. After making corrections, create the End of Period journal entry again.</p>
            <p>d. Print the Core Reports again, along with the Trial Balance Report. </p>
            <p>e. Verify that the Core Reports and the Trial Balance are now in sync.</p>
            <p>6. When the Four Core Reports match the Trial Balance, go ahead and post. Posting to the General Ledger is permanent. Changes can no longer be made to the journal entries; however, adjusting journal entries can always be added to the period if needed. Click <span>General Ledger|Posting</span> and <span class="span_1">Post</span> to the General Ledger. </p>
